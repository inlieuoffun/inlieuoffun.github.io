Their new book, examines the last five years, in which widespread concern about the effects of social media on democracy has led to an explosion in research from different disciplines and corners of academia. The book covers a broad set of topics from disinformation to hate speech to political advertisingâ€”and situates recent developments in the context of key policy questions and reform.\n\n[book]: https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-media-and-democracy/E79E2BBF03C18C3A56A5CC393698F117\n[bookpdf]: https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/E79E2BBF03C18C3A56A5CC393698F117/9781108835558AR.pdf/Social_Media_and_Democracy.pdf\n\n### Related Reading\n\n- [The Butterfly Did It](http://sekhon.berkeley.edu/papers/butterfly.pdf), an analysis of the problems with butterfly-ballot voting machines in Florida in the 2000 election.\n\n- [Elections & Democracy in the Digital Age](https://storage.googleapis.com/kofiannanfoundation.org/2019/02/a6112278-190206_kaf_democracy_internet_persily_single_pages_v3.pdf)\n\n- [From Liberation to Turmoil: Social Media & Democracy](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/from-liberation-to-turmoil-social-media-and-democracy/)"}}
