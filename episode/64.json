He publishes regularly in the nation’s leading academic journals, in the fields of law, politics, and history; his work also appears frequently in the popular press, including the New York Times, Slate, the Los Angeles Times, Politico, and the New Republic.\n\nFriedman has served as a litigator or litigation consultant on a variety of matters in the federal and state courts, and has had a long involvement with social change issues. In addition to his conventional courses in Constitutional Law, Federal Courts, and Criminal Procedure, Friedman teaches seminars in policing, and a new course entitled Judicial Decisionmaking that marries social science about judging with normative and institutional legal questions. He and a set of co-authors from law and the social sciences are writing a course book for the Judicial Decisionmaking course.\n\nFriedman is also the author of *Open Book: The Inside Track to Law School Success*, and talks frequently on the subject. Friedman graduated with honors from the University of Chicago and received his law degree magna cum laude from Georgetown University Law Center. He clerked for Judge Phyllis A. Kravitch of the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit."}}
