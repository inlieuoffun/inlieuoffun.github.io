As the tracker and the tracked, Jon reveals how the stories we tell each other, and the stories spinning in our heads, can be moulded into innovation, love and co-operation — or harnessed to launch armies. Seeking escape from the confusion we create for ourselves and our neighbors with our think-too-much-know-it-all brains, Jon finds liberation within a natural world that spins no fiction.\n\nSet in a high-adventure narrative on the unforgiving savannah, \"[Tracking Lions, Myth, and Wilderness in Samburu][book]\" explores the aboriginal wisdoms that endowed our Stone Age ancestors with the power to survive – and how, since then, myth, art, music, dance, and ceremony have often been hijacked and distorted within our urban, scientific, oil-soaked world.\n\n[book]: https://rmbooks.com/book/tracking-lions-myth-and-wilderness-in-samburu/"}}
