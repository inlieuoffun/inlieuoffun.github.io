For him, the one cannot evolve naturally without the other. His love for wheel thrown pottery started already at age 16 and has evolved into a way of life, his vocation.\n\nFor Eric, shaping objects by hand is not a look back at the past. He firmly believes that hand-crafting objects of a timeless value is a way forward. Eric is a graduate of the Danish school of Design in Copenhagen and has been awarded with a number of grants, international exhibition selections, and other distinguishments for the quality of his work."}}
