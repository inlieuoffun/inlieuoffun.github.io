At a biological level he studies how communication evolves and how the process of evolution encodes information in genomes, but he also looks at how norms and institutions influence research strategies and our scientific understanding of the world.\n\nHis most recent book with Jevin D. West is called “[Calling Bullshit][cb]” and outlines a powerful set of tools to better assess misinformation, disinformation, fake news, and bad science.\n\nHe's also really into crows and ravens.\n\n[cb]: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/563882/calling-bullshit-by-carl-t-bergstrom-and-jevin-d-west/\n\n## Reading List\n\n- \"[Calling Bullshit][cb]\"\n\n### Corvid References\n\n- [@corvidresearch](https://twitter.com/corvidresearch) (Dr. Kaeli Swift)\n- [Corvid research blog](https://corvidresearch.blog/)\n- [Gifts of the Crow](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Gifts-of-the-Crow/John-Marzluff/9781439198742)"}}
