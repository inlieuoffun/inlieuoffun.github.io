We are joined by Ben Smith, media columnist for the New York Times. Ben joined
The New York Times in 2020 after eight years as founding editor in chief of
BuzzFeed News. Before that, he covered politics for Politico, The New York
Daily News, The New York Observer and The New York Sun.

He's also really into crows.
