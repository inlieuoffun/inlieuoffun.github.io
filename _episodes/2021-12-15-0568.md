summary: E. G. Phillips asks us to distinguish truth from fiction
---
We play "Where's the Lie" with a member of the audience: Ducks with Pants!

E.G. Phillips is a San Francisco based songwriter who creates lyric driven songs with his own special blend of whimsy and cinematic imagery which he uses to give a wry take on dealing with the longings of the heart and the madness of existence.  Call it jazz-infused progressive folk if you feel the need to sling around a bunch of genre labels.
