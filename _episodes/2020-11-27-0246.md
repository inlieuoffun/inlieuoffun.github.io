### Authors and Books

- **Jo Nesbø**, author of Norwegian crime novels.

- **John le Carré**: _Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy_, _The Honourable
  Schoolboy_, _Smiley's People_, _The Constant Gardener_, _The Naive and
  Sentimental Lover_.

  Writes Mike Godwin, "For a long time, I read all of LeCarre _[sic],_ but if
  you just read TINKER, TAILOR, then HONOURABLE SCHOOLBOY, then SMILEY'S
  PEOPLE, you've got the core of his best work."

- **Ulysses S. Grant**: _The Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant_.

- **Roger Hall**: _You're Stepping on My Cloak and Dagger_.

- **Richard Hofstadter**: _The Paranoid Style in American Politics_.

  Here's a discussion with Sean Wilentz, Arlie Hochschild, Eric Foner, and Ira
  Katznelson that provides an up-to-date assessment of Hofstadter's work: [The
  Paranoid Style in American Politics: Revisiting Richard Hofstadter in the
  Time of Trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRLdLVfresI)

- **Volker Kutscher**, Author of the books on which the Netflix series _Babylon Berlin_ is based.

- **David E. Hoffmann**: [_The Billion-Dollar Spy_][bds]. See also [Ben's review, on
