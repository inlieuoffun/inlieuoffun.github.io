We are joined by the New York Times's Katie Benner to discuss her astonishing recent stories about former President Trump's efforts to get the Justice Department to overturn the election.

Benner covers the Justice Department for The New York Times and she was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for public service for reporting on workplace sexual harassment issues.

She has worked in The Times' San Francisco Bureau covering Apple, venture capital and startups. She helped steer the paper's coverage of the encryption fight between Apple and the FBI and investigated how tech employees chasing the Silicon Valley dream are short-changed by executives and investors. Most recently she's written about sexual harassment in the tech industry and the legal contracts used to keep that behavior a secret.
