It being Labor Day, we’re joined by Cynthia Estlund, a professor at New York
University Law School and a leading scholar of labor and employment law and
workplace governance.

Estlund's current work focuses on automation and the future of work. Her latest
book, "A New Deal for China’s Workers?" (2017), takes a comparative look at
labor unrest and reform in China. In her previous book, "Regoverning the
Workplace: From Self-Regulation to Co-Regulation" (2010), she chronicled the
current crisis of workplace governance in the US and charted a potential path
forward. Her first book, "Working Together: How Workplace Bonds Strengthen a
Diverse Democracy" (2003), explored the implications of integration,
cooperation, and sociability among co-workers for democratic theory and for the
law of work.

Other writings focus on freedom of speech and procedural fairness at work;
diversity, integration, and affirmative action; critical perspectives on labor
law; and transnational labor rights and regulation.
