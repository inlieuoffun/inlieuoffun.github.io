It being Labor Day, we’re joined by Cynthia Estlund, a professor at New York University Law School and a leading scholar of labor and employment law and workplace governance.

Estlund's current work focuses on automation and the future of work. Her latest book, "A New Deal for China’s Workers?" (2017), takes a comparative look at labor unrest and reform in China. In her previous book, "Regoverning the Workplace: From Self-Regulation to Co-Regulation" (2010), she chronicled the current crisis of workplace governance in the US and charted a potential path forward. Her first book, "Working Together: How Workplace Bonds Strengthen a Diverse Democracy" (2003), explored the implications of integration, cooperation, and sociability among co-workers for democratic theory and for the law of work.

Other writings focus on freedom of speech and procedural fairness at work; diversity, integration, and affirmative action; critical perspectives on labor law; and transnational labor rights and regulation.
