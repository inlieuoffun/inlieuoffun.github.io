Ben has a present for Kate, which comes in the form of having planned the entire upcoming week of *In Lieu of Fun* ahead of time. There's some question whether this is technically allowed by The Rules, but we'll allow it.

Our hosts then address a vibrant list of suggested future guests, before diving into some difficult questions posed by an audience member that challenges Ben and Kate to answer questions about each other. Fortunately, it turns out your hosts like each other, so the answers were enjoyable.

Then things took a more serious turn, when someone asked Kate & Ben to comment about the baffling rise of QAnon from being a fringe conspiracy theory to a set of talking points that elected candidates are speaking up for. Ben has some personal context for the dangers posed by the movement, and offers a very moving and detailed discussion.

The episode wrapped up with Kate's expert quick take on the new [Twitter Transparency Center](https://transparency.twitter.com), and some thoughts on the challenges faced by the Democratic Party in the 2020 election, keeping its constituency focused in the face of its breadth.
