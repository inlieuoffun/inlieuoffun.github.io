We are joined by Brian Beutler, editor in chief of Crooked Media.

Beutler cut his teeth in the crooked media for 12 years before finally dropping
all pretense and joining a company that embraces its Crookedity. He was a
senior congressional reporter for the news site [TPM][tpm] for five years, where he
covered all the major reforms of the Obama era, and the conservative backlash
that ultimately gave rise to Donald Trump. 

He was a columnist for Salon, and comes to Crooked Media from The New Republic,
where he was senior editor, wrote a daily column and hosted the podcast Primary
Concerns. Brian studied physics and astronomy at U.C. Berkeley, where he
graduated without particular distinction in 2004.
