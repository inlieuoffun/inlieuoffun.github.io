We are joined by Miss Punny Pennie, aka Len, a poet working predominantly in
the Scots language, and an advocate for the destigmatisation of mental health
issues. Len is also a student of modern languages at uni and is the creator the
always fascinating "Scots Word of the Day" feature on Twitter, where she can be
found at @Lenniesaurus.
