summary: Discussing the special Grand Jury convened in Manhattan for Trump Org tax issues
---
We are joined by New York Law School professor Rebecca Roiphe to talk about the special grand jury convened in Manhattan on tax issues and the Trump Organization. 

Roiphe studies lawyers’ ethics and the history of the legal profession, focusing on the interaction between lawyers’ work and the rhetoric or ideals of professionalism.

Prior to joining New York Law School, Professor Roiphe worked as a Manhattan prosecutor. She also served as a law clerk for The Honorable Bruce Selya, U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. She draws on her professional experiences and her training as a historian in her writing. Her scholarship emphasizes the important, mediating role prosecutors play in American democracy and examines the country’s tradition of prosecutorial independence, particularly with regard to the President’s power to control the Department of Justice.
