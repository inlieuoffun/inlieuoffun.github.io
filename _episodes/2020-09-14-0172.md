We are joined by Mike Isikoff to discuss his new podcast series "Conspiracyland".

Isikoff is chief investigative correspondent for Yahoo News, where he is also
editor-at-large for reporting and investigations. He digs into national
security, money in politics, and whatever else strikes his fancy.

Previously, he was an investigative correspondent for NBC as well as a staff
writer for Newsweek and the Washington Post. Isikoff has written three
best-sellers: "Uncovering Clinton" and (with David Corn) "Hubris" and "Russian
Roulette".
