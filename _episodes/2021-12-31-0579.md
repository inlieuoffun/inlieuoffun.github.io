Kate offers a synopsis of 2021 in review, to the tune of "We Didn't Start the Fire":

Colin Powell, Betty White, Hank Aaron, cancelled flight  
Frozen Texas, Ted Cruz, Cancun Mexico  
John Madden, Bell Hooks, Space X, banned books  
North Korea, South Korea, Coinbase dot i-o.  

We didn't start the fire  
It was always burning, since the world's been turning  
We didn't start the fire  
No, we didn't light it, but we tried to fight it  

Putin & Navalny, free speech issues clear to see  
Summer Palace, golden throne, doesnâ€™t like what YouTubeâ€™s shown  
Biden, Harris, Brood X, defamation, Zoom sex  
Evergreen, still in place, trouble in the Suez  

We didn't start the fire  
It was always burning, since the world's been turning  
We didn't start the fire  
No, we didn't light it, but we tried to fight it
