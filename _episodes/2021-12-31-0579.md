Kate offers a synopsis of 2021 in review, to the tune of "We Didn't Start the Fire":

Colin Powell, Betty White, Hank Aaron, cancelled flight
Frozen Texas, Ted Cruz, Cancun Mexico
John Madden, Bell Hooks, Space X, banned books
North Korea, South Korea, Coinbase dot i-o.

We didn't start the fire
It was always burning, since the world's been turning
We didn't start the fire
No, we didn't light it, but we tried to fight it

Putin & Navalny, free speech issues clear to see
Summer Palace, golden throne, doesnâ€™t like what YouTubeâ€™s shown
Biden, Harris, Brood X, defamation, Zoom sex
Evergreen, still in place, trouble in the Suez

We didn't start the fire
It was always burning, since the world's been turning
We didn't start the fire
No, we didn't light it, but we tried to fight it
