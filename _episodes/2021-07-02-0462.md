## Announcements

- Every Friday from now on will be Cheese Night, and will always be so henceforth.

- Also: Ben has two new Dog Shirts, to share with the other hosts.

- Also: In Lieu of Fun is now only five days a week, no more weekends. That means (by implication) there will no longer be Mystery Guest Sundays.
