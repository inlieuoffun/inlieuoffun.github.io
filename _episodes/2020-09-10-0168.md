We are joined by Emily Bazelon of the New York Times Magazine and the Slate Political Gabfest to talk about her recent fascination with all the ways our coming election could catastrophize.

We'll also talk criminal justice and Emily's new book, "Charged: The New Movement to Transform American Prosecution and End Mass Incarceration", the Supreme Court, and lots of other stuff.
