We are joined by Emily Bazelon of the New York Times Magazine and the Slate
Political Gabfest to talk about her recent fascination with all the ways our
coming election could catastrophize.

We'll also talk criminal justice and Emily's new book, "Charged: The New
Movement to Transform American Prosecution and End Mass Incarceration", the
Supreme Court, and lots of other stuff
