Stephen Wertheim joins us to talk about America . . . in the world.

Stephen is Deputy Director of Research and Policy at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, which he co-founded. He is also a Research Scholar at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University.

Stephen specializes in U.S. foreign relations and international order from the late nineteenth century to the present. In his book, Tomorrow, the World: The Birth of U.S. Global Supremacy, he reveals how U.S. leaders made a sudden and unexpected decision to pursue global military dominance, which they had previously regarded as unnecessary at best and imperialistic at worst.
