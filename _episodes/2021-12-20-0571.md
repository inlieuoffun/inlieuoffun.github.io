We are joined by “Blue Eagle”—an Afghan pilot evacuated from Afghanistan this summer.

"Blue Eagle" is a member of the Operation Eagle group of helicopter pilots and their families that arrived to the US from Afghanistan this summer. He will talk for the first time broadly about the situation in Afghanistan and the difficult resettlement process.

We will also be joined by Maggie Feldman-Piltch, who has worked with Operation Eagle since the beginning of the crisis.
