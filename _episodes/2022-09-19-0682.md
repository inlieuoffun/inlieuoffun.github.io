## Announcement

The In Lieu of Fun show is coming to an end, with the final ordinary episode being Cheese Night on Friday, September 23rd, 2022.

The hosts plan to hold a follow-up episode, at a time to be determined, to invite back some of the previous guests for a reprise. After that, the intent is to have occasional "surprise" shows every once in a while, not on a regular schedule.
