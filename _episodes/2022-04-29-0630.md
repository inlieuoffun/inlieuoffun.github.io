Ben attends the show from the back of a car taking him to San Francisco Airport to return home from attending a conference, organized by Eli.

Eli takes potshots at Ben about his predilection for dog shirts, and Ben retaliates by calling out Eli for being unemployed. (Eli has since found a new one). Although it is not pugilism week per se, some pugilism did occur.

Discussion proceeded to more serious topics, including the Facebook Oversight Board and the adjudication of online speech issues.
