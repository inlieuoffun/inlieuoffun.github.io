We are joined by John McWhorter of Columbia University to talk languages,
linguistics, and the politics of language.

McWhorter is an associate professor of English and comparative literature at
Columbia University. He earned his B.A. from Rutgers, his M.A. from New York
University, and his Ph.D. in linguistics from Stanford. Professor McWhorter has
taught the American Studies seminar "Language in America," a study of American
linguistic history that considered Native American languages, immigrant
languages, creole languages, and Black English -- their development,
interactions, and preservation. He has also taught the seminar "Language
Contact," which focused specifically on the mixture of language in North
America, and studied the development of creoles, pidgins, koines, "vehicular"
languages, and nonstandard dialects. The seminar considered perceived
legitimacy of languages, and the standing of language mixtures in media and
education.

Professor McWhorter is an author of more than a dozen books including [The
Power of Babel: A Natural History of Language][book1], [Losing the Race: Self
Sabotage in Black America][book2] and [Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue: The
Untold History of English][book3]. In 2016 he published [Words on the Move: Why
English Won't - and Can't - Sit Still (Like, Literally)][book4]. 

He also regularly contributes to newspapers and magazines including The New
Republic and The Atlantic. Students might be particularly interested in his
article on how immigrants change languages in The Atlantic and an essay on
policing the "N-word" in Time.
