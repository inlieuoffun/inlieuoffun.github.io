We are joined by Alicia Wanless!

Wanless is the director of the Partnership for Countering Influence Operations and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. She researches how people shape—and are shaped—by a changing information space. Wanless conducts content and network analysis, and has developed original models for identifying and analyzing digital propaganda campaigns. With more than a decade of experience in researching and analyzing the information environment, focusing on propaganda and information warfare, Wanless applies this learning to support government, military, and major tech companies to develop policies and integrate information activities into training programs that better reflect how the information environment is manipulated.

Wanless is currently a PhD Researcher at King’s College London exploring alternative frameworks for understanding the information environment. Her work has been featured in the CBC, Forbes, and The Strategy Bridge.

She also races sailboats.
