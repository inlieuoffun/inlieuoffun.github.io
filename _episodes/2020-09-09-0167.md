summary: >-
  Discussing the intelligence, problem-solving, and cultural impact of crows
  and other corvids; how misinformation and disformation propagate through
  communication networks
---

Carl Bergstrom is a professor of biology at the University of Washington. At a
biological level he studies how communication evolves and how the process of
evolution encodes information in genomes, but he also looks at how norms and
institutions influence research strategies and our scientific understanding of
the world.

His most recent book with Jevin D. West is called “[Calling Bullshit][cb]” and
outlines a powerful set of tools to better assess misinformation, disinformation,
fake news, and bad science.

He's also really into crows and ravens.
