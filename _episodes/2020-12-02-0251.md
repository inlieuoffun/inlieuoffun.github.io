We are joined by Sarah E. Bond, Associate Professor of History at the
University of Iowaâ€”and a kind of dean of classical Twitter.

Sarah is interested in late Roman history, epigraphy, late antique law, Roman
topography and GIS, Digital Humanities, and the socio-legal experience of
ancient marginal peoples. She received her PhD in History from UNC at Chapel
Hill (2011) and obtained a BA in Classics and History with a minor in Classical
Archaeology from the University of Virginia (2005). Her book, "[Trade and
Taboo: Disreputable Professionals in the Roman Mediterranean][book]", was
published by the University of Michigan Press in 2016.
