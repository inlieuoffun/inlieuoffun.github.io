We are joined by satirist and former CIA officer, Alex Finley. 

Alex is a former officer of the CIA’s Directorate of Operations, where she
served in West Africa and Europe. Before becoming a bureaucrat living large off
the system, she chased puffy white men around Washington DC as a member of the
wild dog pack better known as the Washington media elite.

Her writing has appeared in [Slate][slate],
[Reductress](https://reductress.com/), Funny or Die, POLITICO, and other
publications. She has spoken to C-SPAN’s Washington Journal, CBC’s The
National, Sirius XM’s Yahoo! Politics, The Cipher Brief, the Spy Museum’s
SpyCast, and numerous other media outlets. She is the author of [Victor in the
Rubble][book1], a satire about the CIA and the War on Terror, and [Victor in
the Jungle][book2], a satire about the pitfalls of populism.
