summary: >-
  Ben brings two mystery guests, Ian live in person at the Cabin in the Woods,
  and Dan, in the more conventional way, to talk about the lack of good
  election podcasts and how (or whether) to fix it
---

Gurgi begins the episode by attempting to eat the camera. Once things settle
down, it becomes clear that Ben has observed the lack of good election podcasts
in the world, and launches a conversation between Ian and Dan about what a good
one would look like.

Polled on the question, "Is there a gap in the market, as I believe, for a
truly great election podcast?" the ILoF audience responded in this wise:

| Answer                       | Votes | %     |
|------------------------------|-------|-------|
| Yes                          | 8     | 21.7% |
| No, you're full of shit      | 7     | 18.9% |
| I think so, but I'm not sure | 11    | 29.7% |
| I don't think so, but maybe  | 11    | 29.7% |
| **TOTAL**                    | 37    | 100 % |
