Tom Wheeler is a visiting fellow in Governance Studies at The Brookings
Institution. Wheeler is a businessman, author, and was Chairman of the Federal
Communication Commission (FCC) from 2013 to 2017. 

For over four decades, Wheeler has been involved with new telecommunications
networks and services. At the FCC he led the efforts that resulted in the
adoption of Net Neutrality, privacy protections for consumers, and increased
cybersecurity, among other policies. His chairmanship has been described as,
“The most productive Commission in the history of the agency.”

During the Obama-Biden Transition of 2008/09 Mr. Wheeler led activities
overseeing the agencies of government dealing with science, technology, space
and the arts.

As an entrepreneur, he started or helped start multiple companies offering
innovative cable, wireless and video communications services. He is the only
person to be selected to both the Cable Television Hall of Fame and the
Wireless Hall of Fame, a fact President Obama joked made him “the Bo Jackson of
telecom.”
