We are joined by Nate Persily and Josh Tucker, editors of the new book,
"[Social Media and Democracy: The State of the Field and Prospects for
Reform][book]" ([PDF][bookpdf]).

Persily is the James B. McClatchy Professor of Law at Stanford Law School and a
nationally recognized scholar of constitutional law, election law, and the
democratic process.

Tucker is a professor of politics at NYU, where he also serves as the Director
of the Jordan Center for the Advanced Study of Russia and Co-Director of the
NYU Social Media and Political Participation (SMaPP) lab. Their new book,
examines the last five years, in which widespread concern about the effects of
social media on democracy has led to an explosion in research from different
disciplines and corners of academia. The book covers a broad set of topics from
disinformation to hate speech to political advertisingâ€”and situates recent
developments in the context of key policy questions and reform.
