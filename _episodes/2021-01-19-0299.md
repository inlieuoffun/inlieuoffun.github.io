We are joined by former U.S. Pardon Attorney Margaret Love.

Love specializes in executive clemency and restoration of rights, sentencing and corrections policy, and legal and government ethics. She has written and lectured widely on pardon policy and practice, and on the collateral consequences of a criminal conviction, and is recognized as one of the nationâ€™s leading authorities on clemency and related relief issues.

Love served as U.S. Pardon Attorney between 1990 and 1997, and since leaving public office has successfully represented numerous individuals with federal convictions in the clemency process. She also advises individuals with state convictions who are interested in avoiding or mitigating the collateral consequences of conviction.

She also represents clients seeking other types of clemency, including reduction (commutation) of a prison sentence. With the abolition of parole for federal sentences imposed after 1987, commutation is virtually the only way to reduce a prison term.
