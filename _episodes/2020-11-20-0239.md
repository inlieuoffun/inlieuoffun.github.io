summary: The audience are the guests in this special edition
---
We turn the tables and interview our audience.

We have a lot of interesting people in the ILoF audience. They show up. They
ask questions. They make really interesting points. They seem to know all kinds
of things.

But who are they exactly? This is your chance to meet the audience.

We're gonna bring on audience members—only with consent—to talk about who they
are and tell their stories.

Whom do you want to hear from?
