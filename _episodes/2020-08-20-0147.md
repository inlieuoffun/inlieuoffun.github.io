Sarah Longwell returns to discuss the DNC convention which concludes this
evening, but is derailed because Kate was offline all day and hadn't heard [why
Steven K. Bannon had a rough day today][wsj]. Ben reminded all that the charges are
unproven, but merriment ensured nevertheless. Sarah discusses also focus group

appearances and quarantine is exposing them now to an unfiltered view of the
president. Tune in to hear how that went.
