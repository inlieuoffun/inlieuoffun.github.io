Sarah Longwell returns to discuss the DNC convention which concludes this
evening, but is derailed because Kate was offline all day and hadn't heard [why
Steven K. Bannon had a rough day today][wsj]. Ben reminded all that the charges are
unproven, but merriment ensured nevertheless. Sarah discusses also focus group
insights, to include the fact that a number of Trump voters have not been
focused heretofore on his public statements - but the combination of daily
appearances and quarantine is exposing them now to an unfiltered view of the
president. Tune in to hear how that went.
