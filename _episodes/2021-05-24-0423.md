Slurs Week continues with Yale Philosophy Professor Jason Stanley, who will talk with us about the philosophy of slurs (yes, there is such a field).

Stanley is the Jacob Urowsky Professor of Philosophy at Yale University. In addition to writing on the philosophy of language and epistemology for academic publication, Jason writes about authoritarianism, propaganda, free speech, mass incarceration, and other topics for the popular press.
