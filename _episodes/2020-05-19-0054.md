Both a master potter and designer, Eric is focused on a constant refinement of
both form and technique. For him, the one cannot evolve naturally without the
other. His love for wheel thrown pottery started already at age 16 and has
evolved into a way of life, his vocation.

For Eric, shaping objects by hand is not a look back at the past. He firmly
believes that hand-crafting objects of a timeless value is a way forward. Eric
is a graduate of the Danish school of Design in Copenhagen and has been awarded
with a number of grants, international exhibition selections, and other
distinguishments for the quality of his work.
