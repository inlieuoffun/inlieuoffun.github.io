summary: A discussion and demonstration with a master potter and designer
---
Both a master potter and designer, Eric is focused on a constant refinement of both form and technique. For him, the one cannot evolve naturally without the other. His love for wheel thrown pottery started already at age 16 and has evolved into a way of life, his vocation.

For Eric, shaping objects by hand is not a look back at the past. He firmly believes that hand-crafting objects of a timeless value is a way forward. Eric is a graduate of the Danish school of Design in Copenhagen and has been awarded with a number of grants, international exhibition selections, and other distinguishments for the quality of his work.
