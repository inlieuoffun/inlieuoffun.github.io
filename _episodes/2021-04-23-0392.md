We are joined by Nicole Perlroth, an award-winning cybersecurity journalist for The New York Times, where her work has been optioned for both film and television. She is a regular lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a graduate of Princeton University and Stanford University. She lives with her family in the Bay Area, but increasingly prefers life off the grid in their cabin in the woods.

This episode is hosted by Scott Shapiro, as part of an ongoing move toward expanding the pool of hosts so that Kate and Ben do not have to do it every day. In the future, there may be additional hosts.
