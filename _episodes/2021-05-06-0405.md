Scott and Ben are joined by Anna Lapwood, Twitter's favorite organist.

Anna Lapwood is a trailblazing musician: a conductor, organist, and broadcaster, she is currently Director of Music at Pembroke College, Cambridge.

Anna made her TV presenting debut in 2020 hosting BBC Televisionâ€™s coverage of BBC Young Musician. As a radio broadcaster she is a regular contributor to BBC Radio 3 and Radio 4, and until July 2020, she hosted a live, weekly classical music show on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire. She has also been featured on Classic FM and presented for Scala Radio. A former harpist, Anna now focuses on the organ and gives a substantial number of organ recitals on some of the greatest instruments across Europe each season. This year she will release her first album as an organist, featuring her transcription of Britten's "Four Sea Interludes".
