We are joined by Katie Engelhart—recent winner of the George Polk award for
magazine journalism—to talk about death, dying, COVID, and the inevitability of
it all.

She is the author of "[The Inevitable: Dispatches on the Right to Die][book]".

Engelhart is a writer and producer, based in Toronto and New York, and a
National Fellow at [New America](https://www.newamerica.org/). She previously
worked as a documentary film correspondent & producer at NBC News, where she
reported on illegal nursing home evictions, the black market for abortion
pills, a controversy over the definition of death, a suspicious Taser death in
Texas, an effort to track down brain tissue stolen from Holocaust victims, the
financial struggles of Charlottesville rally survivors, a fake royal family in
Serbia, fake news in Idaho, and the opening of an old secret police archive in
Albania.

She previously worked as a foreign correspondent for VICE News, based in
London, and a roaming Europe reporter for Maclean's, Canada's largest news
magazine.
