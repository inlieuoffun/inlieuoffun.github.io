summary: Discussing differential policing
---
We are joined by Brookings scholar Rashawn Ray to talk about the contrast between the Capitol Police handling on the riot last week and the policing of racial justice protests.

Dr. Ray is a David M. Rubenstein Fellow in Governance Studies at The Brookings Institution, is Professor of Sociology and Executive Director of the Lab for Applied Social Science Research (LASSR) at the University of Maryland, College Park. He is also one of the co-editors of [Contexts Magazine: Sociology for the Public](https://contexts.org/). Formerly, Ray was a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Research Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley.

Ray's research addresses the mechanisms that manufacture and maintain racial and social inequality with a particular focus on police-civilian relations and menâ€™s treatment of women. His work also speaks to ways that inequality may be attenuated through racial uplift activism and social policy.
