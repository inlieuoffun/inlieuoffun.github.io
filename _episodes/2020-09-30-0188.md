We are joined by Tom Nichols, a U.S. Naval War College University Professor,
and an adjunct at the U.S. Air Force School of Strategic Force Studies and the
Harvard Extension School.

He is a specialist on Russian affairs, nuclear strategy, NATO issues, and a
nationally-known commentator on U.S. politics and national security. He was a
staff member in the United States Senate, a fellow at CSIS and the Harvard
Kennedy School, and previously taught at Dartmouth, La Salle, and
Georgetown.

He is also a five-time undefeated 'Jeopardy!' champion, and was noted in the
'Jeopardy!' Hall of Fame after his 1994 appearances as one of the all-time best
players of the game.
