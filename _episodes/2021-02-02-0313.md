summary: Discussing drones
---
We are joined by Nick Weaver, lecturer at the Berkeley in the department of
Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. We're talking drones.

Nick received a B.A. in Astrophysics and Computer Science in 1995, and a
Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2003 both from the University of California at
Berkeley. Although his dissertation was on novel FPGA architectures, he also
was highly interested in Computer Security, including postulating the
possibility of very fast computer worms in 2001.

In 2003, he joined ICSI, first as a postdoc and then as a staff researcher. His
primary research focus is on network security, notably worms, botnets, and
other internet-scale attacks, and network measurement. Other areas have
included both hardware acceleration and software parallelization of network
intrusion detection, defenses for DNS resolvers, and tools for detecting
ISP-introduced manipulations of a user's network connection. He is also a
lecturer in the Computer Science Department at UC Berkeley.
