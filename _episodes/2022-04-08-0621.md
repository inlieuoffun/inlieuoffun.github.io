We are joined by the estimable Vladislav Davidzon, a Ukrainian-Russian dual national from Odessa who recently burned his Russian passport in public to protest the invasion of Ukraine.

Since 2018, he has served as a co-producer for a television series on the effects of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and, since 2012, also serves as the European culture correspondent for Tablet Magazine in Paris, France. While working at the magazine, he has been an investigative journalist and researcher with assignments in Russia, Ukraine, England, and Poland. In 2015, Davidzon founded the Odessa Review and served as its chief editor until July 2018. While he was with Odessa Review, Davidzon helped publish 13 quarterly issues over the course of his tenure at the magazine.

His work has been featured in numerous publications, including the Wall Street Journal, World Policy Journal, the New York Observer, and the American Interest.
