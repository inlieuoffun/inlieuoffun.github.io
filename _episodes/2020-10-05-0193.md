We are joined by Camille Busette, a Senior Fellow in Governance Studies at the
Brookings Institution, where she is the Director of the Race, Prosperity, and
Inclusion Initiative. At Brookings, her work has focused on systemic racism,
the economic advancement of Black and Native American boys, the importance of
social relationships to economic mobility, and equity in healthcare and in
local and state government policy priorities and builds on her work for
low-income populations at EARN (now SaverLife) and the Center for American
Progress.

Prior to joining Brookings, Busette was an executive at the World Bank where
she led the World Bank’s financial inclusion innovation arm, working globally
with technology and financial service executives and with central bank
governors on product, regulatory, data and cybersecurity issues.

Before joining the World Bank, Busette was the inaugural CEO of the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau’s Office of Financial Education, where she
initiated research on financial well-being, and was a member of the Policy and
Executive Management teams there.

Busette has held executive positions at PayPal, Intuit, and NextCard and is a
Public Governor of FINRA, the self-regulatory agency for the broker-dealer
industry.
