With three guest-hosts, this episode covers a lot of ground.

### Topics

- How does DoJ justify effectively immunizing the President from criminal prosecution, given traditional conservative viewpoints on government power? Ben gives a great summary of the mix of law and policy that led from the  Nixon affair to the current state of affairs at the Department of Justice.

  Recommended reading: [A Sitting President's Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution](https://www.justice.gov/file/19351/download), a memorandum of opinion from Oct. 2000.

- The case of Alex Moore, a gay man running for office in Massachusetts, flirted with students on Tinder and got entrapped.  This kind of issue is coming up more lately, especially to gays, and the subjects are treated very poorly by the media. What does the court say about our privacy interests?

- The need for better and more comprehensive protections for privacy and the disposition of intimate information.

- A long and interesting conversation about political messages from the recent Republican National Convention, what appealed to voters and what missed the mark?

  *Tim:* Much of the messaging was targeted toward disengaged white voters, trying to get them activated.  Trump has lost about 4% in recent 4-5 months, among folks who disapproved of him to begin with but voted for him anyway because Hillary. The convention _did_ seem reach these folks to some extent, clawing back some of that loss.

  *Rachel:* Focus groups are hard to read. There has been some erosion among right-leaning independents. These are the folks that Lincoln and RVAT are most affecting. Probably not going to move actual Republicans. They're in social cohorts already disaffected, and the data don't show movement.

- Should we be concerned about the lack of enthusiasm for Biden in key swing districts, e.g., across rural Pennsylvania?

  *Tim:* Yes, panic.  It does no good to not panic.  The enthusiasm gap is real.

- An interesting discussion about the effects of exposing intimate details as in the Katie Hill case. How the lack of privacy, or even the expectation of privacy, affects behaviour.  Nude photos can take careers in politics off the table, and the measurable chilling effect that has on participation.

- The episode wrapped up with recommendations from the host-guests for what to read to become better-informed about their topics of expertise.

And finally, in response to the question of how we really fix things, Tim summed it up pretty well: "I think we should probably vote for the fucking Democrats this time".

### Suggestions

 - [What it Takes](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674659902) by Richard Ben Cramer is by far the definitive introduction to election reporting.
