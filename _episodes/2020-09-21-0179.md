We are joined by David Frum, senior editor at The Atlantic.

From 2014 through 2017, he served as chairman of the board of trustees of the
leading UK center-right think tank, Policy Exchange. In 2001-2002, he served as
speechwriter and special assistant to President George W. Bush; in 2007-2008,
as senior adviser to the Rudy Giuliani presidential campaigns.

Frum is the author of ten books, most recently [Trumpocalypse: Restoring
American Democracy][book1] (HarperCollins, 2020). His first book, [Dead
Right][book2], won praise from William F. Buckley as “the most refreshing
intellectual experience in a generation” and from Frank Rich in the New York
Times as “the smartest book written from the inside about the American
conservative movement.” 

In National Review, John Podhoretz hailed Frum’s history of the 1970s, [How We
Got Here][book3], as “an audacious act of revisionism, written in a voice and
style so original it deserves to be called revolutionary.” Arianna Huffington
said of Frum’s 2012 novel, Patriots, “David Frum is someone who fearlessly
speaks his mind, regardless of where the chips may fall, so it’s no surprise
he’s able to convey so much truth in his fiction.” Frum’s memoir of his service
in the George W. Bush administration, [The Right Man][book4], was a New York
Times bestseller, as was his 2018 book, [Trumpocracy: The Corruption of the
American Republic][book5].

He and his wife Danielle Crittenden Frum live in Washington DC and Wellington,
Ontario. They have three children.
