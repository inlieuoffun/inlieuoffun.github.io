   Discussing coronavirus, shortages of PPE among medical professionals;
   using crowdfunding and 3-D printing to create masks
---

Ben & Kate are joined by Ben's son Gabriel, who has been working on a project to
make 3-D printed mask shells to help local hospitals who are running short of the
essential personal protective equipment they need to combat SARS-CoV-2.

We get a behind-the-scenes tour of the process, some interesting discussion
of the various design trade-offs, and some background on how Gabriel was able to
raise funding to make the project a reality.
