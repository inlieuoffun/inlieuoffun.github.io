the"},{"startSec":396.88,"durationSec":4.319,"text":"case number one"},{"startSec":397.919,"durationSec":4.881,"text":"is that the justice

make"},{"startSec":522.719,"durationSec":4.321,"text":"him testify"},{"startSec":524.399,"durationSec":4.241,"text":"so there's a few problems with this as a"},{"startSec":527.04,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"practical matter"},{"startSec":528.64,"durationSec":4.319,"text":"the first is that he can't be
