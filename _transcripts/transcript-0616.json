frustrating"},{"startSec":1432.32,"durationSec":5.2,"text":"so this is really that in part five"},{"startSec":1435.6,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"yeah go ahead"},{"startSec":1437.52,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"i'm sorry i didn't mean to cut you off i"},{"startSec":1438.96,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"just thought that actually there's a"},{"startSec":1440.72,"durationSec":5.439,"text":"larger question here which is whether"},{"startSec":1443.2,"durationSec":4.64,"text":"law and tech makes any sense i mean and"},{"startSec":1446.159,"durationSec":3.841,"text":"i think that's the"},{"startSec":1447.84,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"that that's the ultimate question we"},{"startSec":1450,"durationSec":2.64,"text":"have that conversation first i want to"},{"startSec":1451.6,"durationSec":2.72,"text":"hear what you're going to say about what"},{"startSec":1452.64,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"you wish about part five but then i have"},{"startSec":1454.32,"durationSec":4.479,"text":"a follow-up to scott's observation

ahead"},{"startSec":1461.84,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"oh so obviously like"},{"startSec":1464.159,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"what i wished in part five was that we"},{"startSec":1465.6,"durationSec":4.319,"text":"had an answer that wasn't just like yeah"},{"startSec":1467.919,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"this is really hard and you should try"},{"startSec":1469.919,"durationSec":4,"text":"to try hard to do it like that would"},{"startSec":1472,"durationSec":5.679,"text":"have been nice um it turns out we don't"},{"startSec":1473.919,"durationSec":6.561,"text":"have that and so eventually we we got"},{"startSec":1477.679,"durationSec":5.521,"text":"something of uh uh i think some useful"},{"startSec":1480.48,"durationSec":4.079,"text":"insights but as i said they're not clear"},{"startSec":1483.2,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"or they're not"},{"startSec":1484.559,"durationSec":3.921,"text":"they're not solutions they're just"},{"startSec":1486.48,"durationSec":4.319,"text":"here's why it's a hard problem the
