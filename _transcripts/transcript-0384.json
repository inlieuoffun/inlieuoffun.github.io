and"},{"startSec":1261.84,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"figure out those rules"},{"startSec":1263.36,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"and then of course world war ii happens"},{"startSec":1265.76,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"and"},{"startSec":1266.4,"durationSec":5.04,"text":"the argument we make is that you know"},{"startSec":1269.44,"durationSec":4.4,"text":"therefore they have at that point worked"},{"startSec":1271.44,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"out all the answers to those

like"},{"startSec":1288.159,"durationSec":7.921,"text":"um and that's why the charter works yeah"},{"startSec":1292.4,"durationSec":5.759,"text":"so i'm curious um coming out of

kind of getting into that type of"},{"startSec":1340.159,"durationSec":3.041,"text":"thing"},{"startSec":1340.72,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"but really like although maybe we should"},{"startSec":1343.2,"durationSec":2.08,"text":"get into that maybe you want to bring"},{"startSec":1344.48,"durationSec":4.64,"text":"that up but like"},{"startSec":1345.28,"durationSec":7.2,"text":"the idea of what technology does to war"},{"startSec":1349.12,"durationSec":5.84,"text":"between in like the in the 20th

one of my areas that i teach is"},{"startSec":1369.76,"durationSec":2.48,"text":"cyborg"},{"startSec":1370.72,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"so one of the big questions we're trying"},{"startSec":1372.24,"durationSec":3.679,"text":"to figure out is like"},{"startSec":1374,"durationSec":4.32,"text":"what does international law mean in the"},{"startSec":1375.919,"durationSec":3.201,"text":"cyber context like what is a violation"},{"startSec":1378.32,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"of article

about"},{"startSec":1423.2,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"these rules in this like totally"},{"startSec":1424.96,"durationSec":4.719,"text":"different"},{"startSec":1426.48,"durationSec":4.96,"text":"technological environment and you know i"},{"startSec":1429.679,"durationSec":4,"text":"those rules are still being"},{"startSec":1431.44,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"worked out i mean one of the key things"},{"startSec":1433.679,"durationSec":2.801,"text":"um"},{"startSec":1434.88,"durationSec":3.52,"text":"we came one of the key conclusions we"},{"startSec":1436.48,"durationSec":4,"text":"came
