now"},{"startSec":1351.76,"durationSec":4.96,"text":"um but for us this was really useful"},{"startSec":1354.08,"durationSec":6.719,"text":"because the raspberry pi is a

is"},{"startSec":1370.24,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"maybe like eighty dollars i'm sure you"},{"startSec":1371.919,"durationSec":5.361,"text":"can get uh some some for

um"},{"startSec":1380.32,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"we added"},{"startSec":1381.52,"durationSec":3.519,"text":"some leds which you can get online"},{"startSec":1384,"durationSec":2.24,"text":"because people"},{"startSec":1385.039,"durationSec":3.361,"text":"do a lot of fun things with the"},{"startSec":1386.24,"durationSec":4.64,"text":"raspberry pi's so it had like a kind

to"},{"startSec":1394.159,"durationSec":6.961,"text":"kind of get into the raspberry pi and"},{"startSec":1397.44,"durationSec":6.719,"text":"um change um the

actually i put it i put a i put the"},{"startSec":1414.48,"durationSec":5.04,"text":"link in"},{"startSec":1417.12,"durationSec":4.559,"text":"uh scott in case people missed it yeah"},{"startSec":1419.52,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"they actually boing boing did a story"},{"startSec":1421.679,"durationSec":3.761,"text":"about"},{"startSec":1422.4,"durationSec":7.04,"text":"um about did corey write this up"},{"startSec":1425.44,"durationSec":5.68,"text":"yeah cory yeah yeah oh cool"},{"startSec":1429.44,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"he's so good at picking out things

so it was actually so yeah i'm"},{"startSec":1438.32,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"sorry go ahead lauren"},{"startSec":1439.36,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"please um i wanted to just add if you"},{"startSec":1441.76,"durationSec":4.96,"text":"ever want to do this"},{"startSec":1443.12,"durationSec":6.559,"text":"um sean our third person who isn't here"},{"startSec":1446.72,"durationSec":4.4,"text":"put it on github so you can just um take"},{"startSec":1449.679,"durationSec":4.401,"text":"whatever i did and"},{"startSec":1451.12,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"and then just use it first yeah yeah so"},{"startSec":1454.08,"durationSec":4.079,"text":"here's the question"},{"startSec":1455.2,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"how would this course be different if"},{"startSec":1458.159,"durationSec":4.64,"text":"say"},{"startSec":1459.44,"durationSec":6.719,"text":"you did it on crowdcast"},{"startSec":1462.799,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"with a live

not"},{"startSec":1479.36,"durationSec":10.88,"text":"like i'm workshopping an idea"},{"startSec":1486.08,"durationSec":7.599,"text":"you want to start um uh um"},{"startSec":1490.24,"durationSec":8.48,"text":"um so"},{"startSec":1493.679,"durationSec":5.041,"text":"actually no you go okay"},{"startSec":1498.84,"durationSec":5.719,"text":"so i"},{"startSec":1501.76,"durationSec":4.72,"text":"i feel the first thing uh would be right"},{"startSec":1504.559,"durationSec":2.881,"text":"that the use of raspberry pi's probably"},{"startSec":1506.48,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"wouldn't be"},{"startSec":1507.44,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"um that that functional in that case um"},{"startSec":1510.64,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"however"},{"startSec":1511.36,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"um for for our second year we actually"},{"startSec":1514.08,"durationSec":2.719,"text":"moved away from raspberry pi's to"},{"startSec":1515.52,"durationSec":4.32,"text":"virtual machines"},{"startSec":1516.799,"durationSec":5.201,"text":"um and there are tools where you can run"},{"startSec":1519.84,"durationSec":4.079,"text":"virtual machines locally on on your"},{"startSec":1522,"durationSec":2.4,"text":"computer uh they're they're for free"},{"startSec":1523.919,"durationSec":3.441,"text":"right"},{"startSec":1524.4,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"it's available um and for example one"},{"startSec":1527.36,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"thing"},{"startSec":1528,"durationSec":6.32,"text":"that could be done is to prepare images"},{"startSec":1531.52,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"for people with like the exercises and"},{"startSec":1534.32,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"everything included"},{"startSec":1535.6,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"that they can download and then"},{"startSec":1537.76,"durationSec":4.48,"text":"essentially run"},{"startSec":1538.88,"durationSec":5.76,"text":"a computer virtually on on their machine"},{"startSec":1542.24,"durationSec":4.559,"text":"to to try out the things if something"},{"startSec":1544.64,"durationSec":4.159,"text":"breaks no problem you just download the"},{"startSec":1546.799,"durationSec":4,"text":"image again and you essentially have"},{"startSec":1548.799,"durationSec":3.681,"text":"a fresh computer so this is actually one"},{"startSec":1550.799,"durationSec":4,"text":"of the issues we had when we"},{"startSec":1552.48,"durationSec":4,"text":"gave students the raspberry pi's because"},{"startSec":1554.799,"durationSec":5.841,"text":"they were extremely"},{"startSec":1556.48,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"good at breaking them and"},{"startSec":1561.44,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"um on a software level right so they"},{"startSec":1563.919,"durationSec":2.561,"text":"didn't do"},{"startSec":1564.48,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"that but they broke the software or the"},{"startSec":1566.48,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"operating system"},{"startSec":1567.6,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"and then we had to kind of you know take"},{"startSec":1570.72,"durationSec":2.8,"text":"them back"},{"startSec":1571.2,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"in and and put put it put it on again"},{"startSec":1573.52,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"right"},{"startSec":1574.24,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"making making sure making sure they work"},{"startSec":1576.4,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"and with the virtual machines it was"},{"startSec":1578,"durationSec":2.159,"text":"much better because we essentially told"},{"startSec":1579.52,"durationSec":2.399,"text":"them look"},{"startSec":1580.159,"durationSec":3.841,"text":"if you break it and it doesn't start"},{"startSec":1581.919,"durationSec":5.76,"text":"anymore delete the old one"},{"startSec":1584,"durationSec":6.24,"text":"go to whatever solution we used canvas"},{"startSec":1587.679,"durationSec":4.161,"text":"right download it again and it will just"},{"startSec":1590.24,"durationSec":5.6,"text":"work like the first day"},{"startSec":1591.84,"durationSec":5.12,"text":"so our support calls were really reduced"},{"startSec":1595.84,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"once we moved there"},{"startSec":1596.96,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"and that's i think what i think would be"},{"startSec":1598.72,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"the first step"},{"startSec":1600.24,"durationSec":4,"text":"when moving this um to youtube is to"},{"startSec":1602.64,"durationSec":4,"text":"give people the

they have a simple way to restoring"},{"startSec":1616.559,"durationSec":2.561,"text":"it"},{"startSec":1617.52,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"right yeah i think i think i think"},{"startSec":1619.12,"durationSec":4.559,"text":"that's right i think that"},{"startSec":1620.72,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"one of the big challenges is going to be"},{"startSec":1623.679,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"um"},{"startSec":1625.6,"durationSec":4.079,"text":"like it always is in in in these kinds"},{"startSec":1628.559,"durationSec":4.161,"text":"of classes"},{"startSec":1629.679,"durationSec":4.801,"text":"which is how to deal with it on the fly"},{"startSec":1632.72,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"so i really want to mention and lauren"},{"startSec":1634.48,"durationSec":1.92,"text":"has mentioned this twice i want to"},{"startSec":1635.76,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"mention

but"},{"startSec":1650.88,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"one of the things that was really"},{"startSec":1652.32,"durationSec":4.8,"text":"important when we had the class"},{"startSec":1654,"durationSec":6.48,"text":"and we we we kept it to 18 people"},{"startSec":1657.12,"durationSec":5.679,"text":"still anybody was teaching a class like"},{"startSec":1660.48,"durationSec":3.52,"text":"we had to like go around the room"},{"startSec":1662.799,"durationSec":3.201,"text":"helping people"},{"startSec":1664,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"with some kind of mess up because things"},{"startSec":1666,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"always got messed up so"},{"startSec":1667.36,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"i think one of the big questions is"},{"startSec":1668.88,"durationSec":5.12,"text":"whether like using breakout rooms for"},{"startSec":1671.6,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"example like something is wrong with the"},{"startSec":1674,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"community can you like signal

you"},{"startSec":1683.279,"durationSec":4.161,"text":"know"},{"startSec":1684,"durationSec":6.559,"text":"like i'm sure the uh"},{"startSec":1687.44,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"it'll be a work in

things"},{"startSec":1700.159,"durationSec":6.961,"text":"that is really kind of surprising is how"},{"startSec":1703.84,"durationSec":6.4,"text":"after after not that much
