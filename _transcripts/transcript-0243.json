with"},{"startSec":189.28,"durationSec":4.72,"text":"like what do you what are you thinking"},{"startSec":190.879,"durationSec":5.761,"text":"about these days let's start with that"},{"startSec":194,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"um let's start with the book and go from"},{"startSec":196.64,"durationSec":2.48,"text":"there because i'll get in trouble if

have a"},{"startSec":209.92,"durationSec":4.879,"text":"copy yet because we're in early stages"},{"startSec":212,"durationSec":4.239,"text":"the book is coming out in on may 25th so"},{"startSec":214.799,"durationSec":5.041,"text":"a long way from now may"},{"startSec":216.239,"durationSec":6.08,"text":"2021 uh the book is called shape"},{"startSec":219.84,"durationSec":5,"text":"and everything in it is about geometry"},{"startSec":222.319,"durationSec":3.681,"text":"in one sense or another so i think i was"},{"startSec":224.84,"durationSec":2.84,"text":"like"},{"startSec":226,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"into it but i still had a lot left to"},{"startSec":227.68,"durationSec":4.479,"text":"write when we last talked and now it is"},{"startSec":229.68,"durationSec":3.759,"text":"put to bed i turned in final artwork"},{"startSec":232.159,"durationSec":3.761,"text":"there are i think uh"},{"startSec":233.439,"durationSec":3.841,"text":"106 hand-drawn drawings in it which i"},{"startSec":235.92,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"all had to do on my

weekend"},{"startSec":242.239,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"um but i think we are going up for"},{"startSec":244.879,"durationSec":2.961,"text":"pre-sale"},{"startSec":245.519,"durationSec":4,"text":"next week so you can actually buy it"},{"startSec":247.84,"durationSec":6.479,"text":"right you won't get it"},{"startSec":249.519,"durationSec":7.601,"text":"but you can purchase it um"},{"startSec":254.319,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"so it's all about geometry but it's kind"},{"startSec":257.12,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"of you told me it was kind of"},{"startSec":258.4,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"in the same spirit as how not to be"},{"startSec":261.04,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"wrong"},{"startSec":262,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"so what what how do how do you not be"},{"startSec":264.8,"durationSec":4.399,"text":"wrong"},{"startSec":265.44,"durationSec":5.36,"text":"using geometry well yeah"},{"startSec":269.199,"durationSec":3.201,"text":"we've all been i mean we've all been"},{"startSec":270.8,"durationSec":3.679,"text":"wrong a lot right about and we can sort"},{"startSec":272.4,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"of go back to what we said about uh"},{"startSec":274.479,"durationSec":3.681,"text":"about uh covet and about sort of"},{"startSec":276.56,"durationSec":2.96,"text":"disease models and spread which we"},{"startSec":278.16,"durationSec":3.039,"text":"talked about when i was last on and"},{"startSec":279.52,"durationSec":4.959,"text":"which there's a lot about in the book"},{"startSec":281.199,"durationSec":5.681,"text":"um it's been a somewhat humbling"},{"startSec":284.479,"durationSec":3.761,"text":"experience right for people who are"},{"startSec":286.88,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"thinking about these things"},{"startSec":288.24,"durationSec":3.679,"text":"mathematically it sort of helps us know"},{"startSec":290.08,"durationSec":4.96,"text":"sort of how much we don't know"},{"startSec":291.919,"durationSec":6.401,"text":"um but what i would say speaking"},{"startSec":295.04,"durationSec":6.4,"text":"loosely is that um"},{"startSec":298.32,"durationSec":5.04,"text":"any context in which we care about

like"},{"startSec":307.759,"durationSec":6.321,"text":"there have been a lot of epidemics in"},{"startSec":311.759,"durationSec":3.201,"text":"the history of humanity and actually

uh"},{"startSec":319.84,"durationSec":5.919,"text":"writing this book um and in some sense"},{"startSec":324,"durationSec":3.52,"text":"everything that we do when we try to do"},{"startSec":325.759,"durationSec":4.961,"text":"things predictively is say"},{"startSec":327.52,"durationSec":4.64,"text":"um which epidemics in the past is this"},{"startSec":330.72,"durationSec":2.96,"text":"epidemic like"},{"startSec":332.16,"durationSec":2.64,"text":"like what's our notion of similarity

whether it's"},{"startSec":339.6,"durationSec":4.159,"text":"epidemic"},{"startSec":340.479,"durationSec":4.961,"text":"is uh is to say here's the situation

then we'll expect that this will"},{"startSec":348.4,"durationSec":2.72,"text":"behave the way that similar things"},{"startSec":349.759,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"behave but this notion of similarity is"},{"startSec":351.12,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"a fundamentally geometric notion because"},{"startSec":352.639,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"we're asking how close things"},{"startSec":354.32,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"are in some kind of conceptual space of"},{"startSec":356.479,"durationSec":3.761,"text":"all possible epidemics or all

similar"},{"startSec":367.6,"durationSec":6.039,"text":"to similarity in non-geometry"},{"startSec":371.36,"durationSec":4,"text":"i mean when i when you say similar"},{"startSec":373.639,"durationSec":6.68,"text":"colloquially"},{"startSec":375.36,"durationSec":6.959,"text":"you mean reminiscent of in some

geometry"},{"startSec":390.479,"durationSec":6.56,"text":"you mean having the same angles as"},{"startSec":395.039,"durationSec":3.761,"text":"right you mean something much memory"},{"startSec":397.039,"durationSec":3.72,"text":"okay um"},{"startSec":398.8,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"so what i would say first of all i would"},{"startSec":400.759,"durationSec":3.72,"text":"imperialistically say there is nothing"},{"startSec":402.96,"durationSec":2.32,"text":"outside of geometry like once you're"},{"startSec":404.479,"durationSec":3.121,"text":"talking about"},{"startSec":405.28,"durationSec":3.199,"text":"similarity you are essentially
