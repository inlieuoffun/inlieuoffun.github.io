um"},{"startSec":256.72,"durationSec":6.64,"text":"and like like who started it"},{"startSec":260.479,"durationSec":4.401,"text":"well um experimental philosophy is this"},{"startSec":263.36,"durationSec":2.8,"text":"sort of relatively new movement that"},{"startSec":264.88,"durationSec":2.08,"text":"started at the beginning of the

where"},{"startSec":273.199,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"you're running experiments on people so"},{"startSec":276.32,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"from really early in the history of"},{"startSec":277.759,"durationSec":3.121,"text":"philosophy there was this idea that"},{"startSec":279.52,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"one way that we can make progress on"},{"startSec":280.88,"durationSec":3.039,"text":"philosophical questions is by thinking"},{"startSec":282.4,"durationSec":3.359,"text":"about kind of our intuitions

getting"},{"startSec":297.36,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"some sense about what justice really is"},{"startSec":299.52,"durationSec":3.679,"text":"and experimental philosophy is very"},{"startSec":301.52,"durationSec":2.56,"text":"continuous without really long tradition"},{"startSec":303.199,"durationSec":2.641,"text":"in philosophy"},{"startSec":304.08,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"but it's something that's done"},{"startSec":305.84,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"experimentally so"},{"startSec":307.36,"durationSec":2.96,"text":"instead of just saying like consider"},{"startSec":308.72,"durationSec":2.64,"text":"this case surely you'd think the"},{"startSec":310.32,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"following thing about it"},{"startSec":311.36,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"it's that we say you know we gave 500"},{"startSec":313.68,"durationSec":2.959,"text":"people this case"},{"startSec":314.96,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"participants were randomly assigned

systematic"},{"startSec":335.28,"durationSec":5.52,"text":"quantitative experimental studies"},{"startSec":337.68,"durationSec":5.359,"text":"i think the best i think the best way to"},{"startSec":340.8,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"get into experimental philosophy"},{"startSec":343.039,"durationSec":3.681,"text":"is to talk about the knob effect um"},{"startSec":345.68,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"which is"},{"startSec":346.72,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"a really interesting effect and
