yeah"},{"startSec":290.479,"durationSec":4.241,"text":"i mean it's we try to make it difficult"},{"startSec":292.479,"durationSec":5.681,"text":"anyway um"},{"startSec":294.72,"durationSec":5.759,"text":"but so um elizabeth"},{"startSec":298.16,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"give us updates what is your lab how is"},{"startSec":300.479,"durationSec":3.681,"text":"your lab running what are you working on"},{"startSec":302.4,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"tell us about tell us just i don't know"},{"startSec":304.16,"durationSec":2.879,"text":"give us an intro to your work on what"},{"startSec":305.6,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"you're working on right now"},{"startSec":307.039,"durationSec":5.201,"text":"yeah um good question um"},{"startSec":310.16,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"where am i uh so i don't know you want"},{"startSec":312.24,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"like a five-minute version of like what"},{"startSec":313.84,"durationSec":2.72,"text":"the big problems are and cognitive and"},{"startSec":315.84,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"science and"},{"startSec":316.56,"durationSec":6.479,"text":"yeah and sort of great yeah yeah so"},{"startSec":320,"durationSec":5.6,"text":"um you know so i'm interested in the"},{"startSec":323.039,"durationSec":3.281,"text":"uh fundamental mechanisms of human"},{"startSec":325.6,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"cognition"},{"startSec":326.32,"durationSec":6.24,"text":"and and so i think one of the"},{"startSec":329.36,"durationSec":4.399,"text":"the coolest things that um makes human"},{"startSec":332.56,"durationSec":3.919,"text":"intelligence unique"},{"startSec":333.759,"durationSec":4.401,"text":"um as we're comparing it say with ai or"},{"startSec":336.479,"durationSec":3.681,"text":"other"},{"startSec":338.16,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"intelligence that's out there is is that"},{"startSec":340.16,"durationSec":2.8,"text":"our we have this incredible capacity to"},{"startSec":342.32,"durationSec":3.439,"text":"make"},{"startSec":342.96,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"very rich inferences um from very"},{"startSec":345.759,"durationSec":3.761,"text":"limited data"},{"startSec":346.8,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"so we get a sparse amount of data and"},{"startSec":349.52,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"all of a sudden we've generated"},{"startSec":350.96,"durationSec":3.519,"text":"all sorts of theories and

about"},{"startSec":357.28,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"how the world works"},{"startSec":359.28,"durationSec":3.919,"text":"and it's very very different from say"},{"startSec":361.44,"durationSec":4.8,"text":"how our current"},{"startSec":363.199,"durationSec":5.601,"text":"state-of-the-art ai programs are"},{"startSec":366.24,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"operating where they have millions if"},{"startSec":368.8,"durationSec":4,"text":"not you know billions of training sets"},{"startSec":371.12,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"and just to get to the point where if"},{"startSec":372.8,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"you ask it a common sense question like"},{"startSec":375.36,"durationSec":3.279,"text":"you know i showed up at the ice cream"},{"startSec":376.96,"durationSec":2.4,"text":"store and i forgot my wallet what do i"},{"startSec":378.639,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"do"},{"startSec":379.36,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"its response is something like buy ice"},{"startSec":382.319,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"cream anyhow"},{"startSec":383.12,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"or ice cream is cold you should uh you"},{"startSec":385.919,"durationSec":3.041,"text":"know"},{"startSec":386.96,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"borrow you know you should go back home"},{"startSec":388.96,"durationSec":2.32,"text":"and get your freezer"},{"startSec":390,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"or like something like that which"},{"startSec":391.28,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"doesn't make any sense in the context of"},{"startSec":393.12,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"like causal reasoning and intuitive"},{"startSec":395.52,"durationSec":4.239,"text":"um our sort of intuitive common sense"},{"startSec":398,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"and so the cool thing about humans is we"},{"startSec":399.759,"durationSec":4.321,"text":"can do this right and"},{"startSec":401.12,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"and so children are particularly uh"},{"startSec":404.08,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"fascinating because"},{"startSec":405.28,"durationSec":4.319,"text":"they're the fastest learning machines"},{"startSec":407.68,"durationSec":4.959,"text":"that we know of in the universe"},{"startSec":409.599,"durationSec":3.921,"text":"um and so i study them and i i look at"},{"startSec":412.639,"durationSec":2.481,"text":"their"},{"startSec":413.52,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"way that children learn about the world"},{"startSec":415.12,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"how they form coherent"},{"startSec":417.12,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"rich causal theories about all sorts of"},{"startSec":419.36,"durationSec":3.679,"text":"things um"},{"startSec":420.8,"durationSec":5.519,"text":"uh after just don't they don't always"},{"startSec":423.039,"durationSec":6.16,"text":"get cause and effect right"},{"startSec":426.319,"durationSec":4.241,"text":"you know the the thing about intuitive"},{"startSec":429.199,"durationSec":3.601,"text":"common sense theories"},{"startSec":430.56,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"is that they're built on our"},{"startSec":432.8,"durationSec":4,"text":"observations of"},{"startSec":434,"durationSec":3.919,"text":"how of the world um and so there's all"},{"startSec":436.8,"durationSec":3.839,"text":"sorts of stuff that"},{"startSec":437.919,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"that we see in the world um that"},{"startSec":440.639,"durationSec":2.641,"text":"conflicts with our intuitive common"},{"startSec":442.479,"durationSec":2.56,"text":"sense so"},{"startSec":443.28,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"actually there's a great book by this uh"},{"startSec":445.039,"durationSec":2.801,"text":"on this oh i have it"},{"startSec":446.56,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"i'm gonna do funny thing where i"},{"startSec":447.84,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"advertise other people's books i'm"},{"startSec":449.44,"durationSec":5.039,"text":"attached to my computer can i do that is"},{"startSec":450.96,"durationSec":3.519,"text":"that okay yes of course yes"},{"startSec":454.56,"durationSec":5.919,"text":"so um actually andrew stulman"},{"startSec":457.84,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"has a great book hey andrew shout out

about"},{"startSec":466,"durationSec":4.8,"text":"like why we sometimes get things wrong"},{"startSec":468.639,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"um but the ways in which we get things"},{"startSec":470.8,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"wrong are still pretty smart"},{"startSec":472.319,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"um and the way that kids get

and"},{"startSec":499.12,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"the daughter said um that's a good"},{"startSec":500.56,"durationSec":3.359,"text":"question i think it's because"},{"startSec":502.16,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"the airplane is so loud that you"},{"startSec":503.919,"durationSec":3.521,"text":"wouldn't be able to hear if you had a"},{"startSec":505.44,"durationSec":4.479,"text":"phone conversation"},{"startSec":507.44,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"right so so so she's wrong that's not"},{"startSec":509.919,"durationSec":2.881,"text":"why we can't"},{"startSec":510.72,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"use our phones on airplanes but it's"},{"startSec":512.8,"durationSec":3.679,"text":"it's also right"},{"startSec":514.08,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"like it's a good explanation right so"},{"startSec":516.479,"durationSec":2.8,"text":"it's true that kids get cause and effect"},{"startSec":518.24,"durationSec":2.96,"text":"wrong it's true
