uh"},{"startSec":433.44,"durationSec":4.4,"text":"uh in uh"},{"startSec":438.24,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"um but anyway that's my first question"},{"startSec":441.039,"durationSec":4.961,"text":"is there actual"},{"startSec":442.16,"durationSec":7.28,"text":"evidence that crows and really smart"},{"startSec":446,"durationSec":5.199,"text":"yeah that's an amazing image yeah yeah"},{"startSec":449.44,"durationSec":3.039,"text":"and uh the ministers look like like"},{"startSec":451.199,"durationSec":4.961,"text":"chops um"},{"startSec":452.479,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"anyway um so uh is there actual evidence"},{"startSec":456.16,"durationSec":2.72,"text":"yes"},{"startSec":456.56,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"that

actually"},{"startSec":485.36,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"the face that the crows were recognizing"},{"startSec":487.28,"durationSec":2.479,"text":"and so they did these very nice"},{"startSec":488.4,"durationSec":4.72,"text":"experiments where they"},{"startSec":489.759,"durationSec":6.481,"text":"um they would uh they would"},{"startSec":493.12,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"uh wear masks and the and there were"},{"startSec":496.24,"durationSec":2.959,"text":"masks that would"},{"startSec":497.28,"durationSec":3.199,"text":"that had been used to track crows and"},{"startSec":499.199,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"then there were masks
