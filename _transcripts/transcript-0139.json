talk"},{"startSec":275.919,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"through"},{"startSec":277.28,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"what uh what the assumptions are in"},{"startSec":280.479,"durationSec":3.841,"text":"eliot's model"},{"startSec":281.44,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"that uh make it more optimistic

models differ how you do a model of"},{"startSec":296.08,"durationSec":4,"text":"a presidential election"},{"startSec":297.6,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"and we're gonna front load all of

i'm"},{"startSec":307.759,"durationSec":3.041,"text":"just finding this"},{"startSec":308.56,"durationSec":4.4,"text":"so are you working with andrew gellman"},{"startSec":310.8,"durationSec":4.959,"text":"uh yeah gelman and one of his tas"},{"startSec":312.96,"durationSec":4.32,"text":"merlin also helped out with the design"},{"startSec":315.759,"durationSec":4.401,"text":"of the model yeah"},{"startSec":317.28,"durationSec":4,"text":"okay and like so um for those who don't"},{"startSec":320.16,"durationSec":3.039,"text":"know andrew gellman is"},{"startSec":321.28,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"one of the most famous kind

a scandal involving like i'm"},{"startSec":336.639,"durationSec":3.201,"text":"in psychology and so what there was a"},{"startSec":338.4,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"scandal that was kind of involving"},{"startSec":339.84,"durationSec":5.6,"text":"gilman or a couple of years ago around"},{"startSec":343.28,"durationSec":4.96,"text":"his supervision of a phd student

an"},{"startSec":355.12,"durationSec":5.44,"text":"unfortunate blow back"},{"startSec":356.96,"durationSec":4.72,"text":"on on gilman uh and had like very little"},{"startSec":360.56,"durationSec":2.479,"text":"to do more it was more"},{"startSec":361.68,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"i would say that it was more kind of a"},{"startSec":363.039,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"commentary on how"},{"startSec":365.12,"durationSec":3.359,"text":"the relationships between grad

little"},{"startSec":374.319,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"kind of"},{"startSec":374.72,"durationSec":4.72,"text":"actual oversight um but anyways uh"},{"startSec":377.759,"durationSec":3.681,"text":"so i'm not like i'm not like this isn't"},{"startSec":379.44,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"like going to be like some huge like i'm"},{"startSec":381.44,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"you know i'm like against uh andrew"},{"startSec":383.6,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"gelman i've long"},{"startSec":384.56,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"been a fan of his work um how has it"},{"startSec":386.96,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"been kind of putting this model together"},{"startSec":389.12,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"and what were some of the things that"},{"startSec":390.88,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"you decided"},{"startSec":392.56,"durationSec":4.96,"text":"um to include and to not include and why"},{"startSec":395.44,"durationSec":5.599,"text":"or why not"},{"startSec":397.52,"durationSec":5.2,"text":"well any well i like designing models i"},{"startSec":401.039,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"mean i guess that's why i do it um so"},{"startSec":402.72,"durationSec":6.4,"text":"it's been rewarding"},{"startSec":404.319,"durationSec":8.16,"text":"uh it's tough though we chose to pursue"},{"startSec":409.12,"durationSec":4.479,"text":"a formerly bayesian model and what that"},{"startSec":412.479,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"means is that we"},{"startSec":413.599,"durationSec":6.081,"text":"wanted to take into account all the"},{"startSec":416.639,"durationSec":4.881,"text":"sources of uncertainty in our data and"},{"startSec":419.68,"durationSec":3.359,"text":"basically we decided to code the model"},{"startSec":421.52,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"in like a really arcane statistical"},{"startSec":423.039,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"language that's pretty hard to learn so"},{"startSec":424.72,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"there was a learning curve with"},{"startSec":426.319,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"developing it um"},{"startSec":428.4,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"but it's been a good and rewarding"},{"startSec":430.4,"durationSec":4.639,"text":"process i mean the purpose"},{"startSec":432,"durationSec":6.24,"text":"of building a model i guess is to"},{"startSec":435.039,"durationSec":4.241,"text":"try to think through uh what causes an"},{"startSec":438.24,"durationSec":4.239,"text":"event to happen"},{"startSec":439.28,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"or not to happen so"},{"startSec":442.479,"durationSec":3.521,"text":"since i have a background in

why"},{"startSec":448.72,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"people vote"},{"startSec":449.599,"durationSec":4.561,"text":"this was this was great because uh you"},{"startSec":452.16,"durationSec":4.96,"text":"get to apply all of your theories about"},{"startSec":454.16,"durationSec":4.159,"text":"why and how people vote to a live"},{"startSec":457.12,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"election forecast"},{"startSec":458.319,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"um and i think that that yielded a

am"},{"startSec":464.4,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"hypothesizing that it will end up"},{"startSec":466.08,"durationSec":4.399,"text":"yielding benefits over um

election"},{"startSec":472.16,"durationSec":5.039,"text":"day happens whether that's the case"},{"startSec":474.4,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"but it allowed us to i think iterate on"},{"startSec":477.199,"durationSec":3.601,"text":"the traditional"},{"startSec":478,"durationSec":4.319,"text":"like let's aggregate polls and simulate"},{"startSec":480.8,"durationSec":4.32,"text":"uncertainty in the election"},{"startSec":482.319,"durationSec":4.72,"text":"with some more nuance like um we think"},{"startSec":485.12,"durationSec":3.199,"text":"elections are easier to predict now than"},{"startSec":487.039,"durationSec":2.321,"text":"they used to be because people are more"},{"startSec":488.319,"durationSec":3.361,"text":"polarized"},{"startSec":489.36,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"and we think that elect that

think"},{"startSec":497.68,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"through all these different uh"},{"startSec":499.28,"durationSec":3.199,"text":"factors and i think a really"},{"startSec":500.96,"durationSec":3.519,"text":"intellectually rewarding way"},{"startSec":502.479,"durationSec":3.521,"text":"um and on the upside like people are"},{"startSec":504.479,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"interested in"},{"startSec":506,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"what that model produces um so we also"},{"startSec":508.56,"durationSec":2.16,"text":"get to"},{"startSec":509.28,"durationSec":4.239,"text":"cover the horse race a little bit better"},{"startSec":510.72,"durationSec":6.08,"text":"than i think the pundits do"},{"startSec":513.519,"durationSec":6.161,"text":"so what what are the basic"},{"startSec":516.8,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"i mean you have a giant world of data at"},{"startSec":519.68,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"your"},{"startSec":520,"durationSec":6.48,"text":"disposal um uh"},{"startSec":523.12,"durationSec":4,"text":"some good some bad what goes into the"},{"startSec":526.48,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"model"},{"startSec":527.12,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"like what what what does your model"},{"startSec":529.6,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"consider"},{"startSec":531.2,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"yeah i actually would push back against"},{"startSec":533.04,"durationSec":2.96,"text":"the claim that we have a world of data"},{"startSec":534.64,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"or at least i would say that that world"},{"startSec":536,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"of data is smaller i think than people"},{"startSec":538,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"think it is so this is actually a pretty"},{"startSec":539.68,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"hard problem um"},{"startSec":541.44,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"it's not that you know we have"},{"startSec":543.12,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"interviews from a million people"},{"startSec":544.88,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"and we get to leverage all
