not"},{"startSec":260.799,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"um in this in this field so yeah that's"},{"startSec":262.96,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"just kind of like a very threshold issue"},{"startSec":264.88,"durationSec":4.96,"text":"i know that that seems super basic but i"},{"startSec":266.72,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"was wondering if we could start there"},{"startSec":270.08,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"yeah no i don't think that's actually a"},{"startSec":272,"durationSec":5.36,"text":"basic question at all it's a super hard"},{"startSec":274.16,"durationSec":6.08,"text":"question and it turns out um it's"},{"startSec":277.36,"durationSec":4.8,"text":"it's a pathology of writing about ai

and"},{"startSec":310.72,"durationSec":4.64,"text":"i'm kind of like"},{"startSec":312.8,"durationSec":5.2,"text":"whatever like sure if you want to

about and i don't think that's"},{"startSec":323.36,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"what most people are talking about when"},{"startSec":324.56,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"they say like hey ai is changing

i"},{"startSec":334.32,"durationSec":4.319,"text":"think this is"},{"startSec":335.68,"durationSec":5.04,"text":"relatively broadly"},{"startSec":338.639,"durationSec":4.321,"text":"acceptable within

machine"},{"startSec":372.96,"durationSec":4.72,"text":"like do your best and it will hopefully"},{"startSec":375.36,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"give us some sort of outputs that either"},{"startSec":377.68,"durationSec":4,"text":"mimic what humans do maybe do better"},{"startSec":379.6,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"than humans do maybe do the same sort
