<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Baby Cannon</strong>: Is a very small cannon that Ben
      accidentally <a href="https://inlieuof.fun/glossary.html">made famous on
      Twitter</a>. (S)he has
      occasionally <a href="https://inlieuof.fun/episode/31">shown up on
      ILoF</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/FamjIjc_XOs?t=3978">blown things
      up</a>, including <a href="https://youtu.be/1UE8wrilGKU?t=3274">Ben's
      computer</a>. Don't ask whether Baby Cannon is male or female -- the
      answer is "yes". See Baby
      Cannon <a href="https://twitter.com/benjaminwittes/status/880597124794200064">destroy
      a soda</a>
      and <a href="https://twitter.com/benjaminwittes/status/1116330206514434048">assault
      some eggs</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Baby Prosecco</strong>: A small bottle of Prosecco, the
      occasional <a href="http://inlieuof.fun/episode/114">target and
      persistent nemesis of Baby Cannon</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Cheese Night</strong>: ðŸ§€
      Since <a href="https://inlieuof.fun/episode/462">Episode 462</a>, some shows -- usually
      on Friday, but not always -- are designated as "Cheese Night", in which
      the hosts eat cheese and there is no designated guest. Cheese Night takes
      the place of the old tradition of Saturday show-planning shows and
      Mystery Guest Sundays.</p></li>

  <li><p>The <strong>Greek Chorus</strong>: A semi-affectionate term for the
      regular audience who attend live shows via Crowdcast, and who maintain a
      lively and intellectually-vibrant (if sometimes irreverent) running
      commentary in the live chat that accompanies the broadcast.</p></li>

  <li><p>The <strong>Lisa Page puppet</strong>: An impromptu hand-puppet made to
      stand in for Lisa Page, who
      was <a href="https://youtu.be/aOxJQY-rSsg?t=65">unable to attend the show
      live</a> in <a href="http://inlieuof.fun/episode/26">episode 26</a> for
      professional reasons.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Mystery Guest Sunday</strong>: A show tradition from March 29,
      2020 until June 27, 2021, in which one of the hosts would invite a
      Mystery Guest to come on the show, and the others would try to guess who
      it would be.  Mystery Guest Sundays were discontinued when the
      show <a href="https://inlieuof.fun/episode/462">stopped airing on
      weekends</a>. See also <em>Cheese Night</em>.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Norms</strong>: Standards or patterns, especially of social
      behavior, that are typical or expected of a group. Mentioning or discussing the
      failure of institutional checks and balances due to the breakdown of norms may
      result in the cry of "norms, drink!" from the Greek Chorus.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Rapturing</strong>: The process of inviting an audience member
      on-screen to ask a question of the hosts or a guest. A whimsical allusion
      to the eschatological conceit
      of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture">The Rapture</a> in
      which the elect are supposed to be lifted up into a state of grace</p></li>
</ul>
