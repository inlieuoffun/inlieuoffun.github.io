There's a coronavirus pandemic on. We aren't allowed to have fun anymore; but
*in lieu of fun*, you can grab a beverage of your choice and come hang out with
us, your hosts [Ben Wittes][ben] and [Kate Klonick][kate], every day at 5:00pm
US Eastern time.

**In Lieu of Fun** is a casual, unstructured webcast that has been broadcasting
daily since March 25, 2020.  We talk about news, law, life, art, squirrels,
murder hornets, Baby Cannons, and whatever else may come up. On most weekdays
there are pre-announced guests, while Saturdays are just Ben & Kate planning
the upcoming week. Sundays usually include an unannounced Mystery Guest.

Episodes are streamed live on Crowdcast, YouTube, and a variety of other
streaming platforms, and you can watch recordings of past episodes from the [In
Lieu of Fun channel][yt] on YouTube.
