it's true so um i actually i did them"},{"startSec":258.239,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"bizarrely enough as a joint degree"},{"startSec":260.479,"durationSec":3.601,"text":"um so there are there are a decent"},{"startSec":261.919,"durationSec":2.56,"text":"number of people in the academy who do"},{"startSec":264.08,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"kind of"},{"startSec":264.479,"durationSec":6.881,"text":"ip or sciencey law who have phds"},{"startSec":267.68,"durationSec":5.6,"text":"and i think almost without exception"},{"startSec":271.36,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"they did a phd and then decided no law"},{"startSec":273.28,"durationSec":2.24,"text":"is what they want to do and then one got"},{"startSec":274.56,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"a law degree"},{"startSec":275.52,"durationSec":4.48,"text":"um i'm there might be others but there"},{"startSec":278.16,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"are certainly not many people who did"},{"startSec":280,"durationSec":4.72,"text":"joint jd phd's"},{"startSec":281.44,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"in the science in the hard sciences so i"},{"startSec":284.72,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"did it as a"},{"startSec":285.68,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"joint degree in law and biology i knew"},{"startSec":288,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"that this is what i wanted to do"},{"startSec":289.6,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"from kind of the get-go um be thinking"},{"startSec":292.16,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"about how"},{"startSec":292.8,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"science influences law and how law"},{"startSec":295.04,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"shaped science"},{"startSec":296,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"uh and so i did them both at the same"},{"startSec":298.32,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"time which was"},{"startSec":299.36,"durationSec":3.52,"text":"weird and kind of fun"},{"startSec":303.44,"durationSec":6.56,"text":"super interesting so um"},{"startSec":306.479,"durationSec":6.801,"text":"do you do any uh any"},{"startSec":310,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"biology research or at this point or is"},{"startSec":313.28,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"that just"},{"startSec":314.08,"durationSec":5.76,"text":"a a background"},{"startSec":317.52,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"expertise for purposes of your legal"},{"startSec":319.84,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"scholarship"},{"startSec":322.08,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"that's just background that's just for"},{"startSec":323.68,"durationSec":2.64,"text":"legal scholarship um"},{"startSec":325.28,"durationSec":3.52,"text":"now so i was in a protein"},{"startSec":326.32,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"crystallography lab uh and it turns out"},{"startSec":328.8,"durationSec":2.64,"text":"it's"},{"startSec":329.36,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"protein crystallography is not really a"},{"startSec":331.44,"durationSec":4.4,"text":"side hobby"},{"startSec":332.72,"durationSec":6.64,"text":"um plus"},{"startSec":335.84,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"i i don't i you said i mean i don't like"},{"startSec":339.36,"durationSec":2.24,"text":"it"},{"startSec":339.6,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"i don't like admitting this super often"},{"startSec":341.6,"durationSec":5.599,"text":"i have no idea what that is"},{"startSec":344.16,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"like protein crystallography like i"},{"startSec":347.199,"durationSec":2.56,"text":"can't even"},{"startSec":347.84,"durationSec":5.12,"text":"i know all of those words but none of"},{"startSec":349.759,"durationSec":5.841,"text":"that i don't know how they fit together"},{"startSec":352.96,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"um so you know those fun pictures of"},{"startSec":355.6,"durationSec":5.52,"text":"molecules that you see that have like"},{"startSec":357.84,"durationSec":4.72,"text":"spiraled ribbons um and like little"},{"startSec":361.12,"durationSec":3.359,"text":"lines and things like that you're like"},{"startSec":362.56,"durationSec":5.359,"text":"oh that's what the molecule looks like"},{"startSec":364.479,"durationSec":6.72,"text":"protein crystallography is one of two"},{"startSec":367.919,"durationSec":5.84,"text":"big ways that we get those pictures um"},{"startSec":371.199,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"basically you purify the protein and"},{"startSec":373.759,"durationSec":2.641,"text":"make a crystal out of it and you shine"},{"startSec":375.28,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"x-rays through it"},{"startSec":376.4,"durationSec":4.239,"text":"and see how they scatter and essentially"},{"startSec":378.56,"durationSec":4,"text":"the analogy i would draw is"},{"startSec":380.639,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"it's as if you had a rock that you"},{"startSec":382.56,"durationSec":2.8,"text":"couldn't see"},{"startSec":383.759,"durationSec":3.201,"text":"and you have a pond and the way to"},{"startSec":385.36,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"figure out the shape of the rock is to"},{"startSec":386.96,"durationSec":3.519,"text":"throw the rock into the pond over and"},{"startSec":388.8,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"over and over again and look at the"},{"startSec":390.479,"durationSec":2.881,"text":"ripples around the edge and try to"},{"startSec":391.84,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"figure out from that what shape the rock"},{"startSec":393.36,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"was"},{"startSec":394.72,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"oh that was that is like a fascinating"},{"startSec":397.28,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"analogy i can't"},{"startSec":398.4,"durationSec":4,"text":"ever imagine figuring out the shape of a"},{"startSec":400.96,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"rock that way"},{"startSec":402.4,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"myself but i imagine that if i have the"},{"startSec":404.72,"durationSec":3.52,"text":"right tools to measure"},{"startSec":406.08,"durationSec":3.839,"text":"said ripples i could probably do it so"},{"startSec":408.24,"durationSec":4.239,"text":"that like that makes a little bit more"},{"startSec":409.919,"durationSec":5.601,"text":"sense how does one capture it like"},{"startSec":412.479,"durationSec":4.881,"text":"on film like the like that actually"},{"startSec":415.52,"durationSec":5.36,"text":"happening"},{"startSec":417.36,"durationSec":6,"text":"um so you know those really big"},{"startSec":420.88,"durationSec":4,"text":"uh circular synchrotron things like"},{"startSec":423.36,"durationSec":2.8,"text":"whenever you see like a huge giant"},{"startSec":424.88,"durationSec":1.84,"text":"scientific laboratory where it's like"},{"startSec":426.16,"durationSec":2.96,"text":"they're"},{"startSec":426.72,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"they're running things around and around"},{"startSec":429.12,"durationSec":5.84,"text":"in a circle really fast"},{"startSec":430.8,"durationSec":6.16,"text":"yeah um so at a number of points"},{"startSec":434.96,"durationSec":4,"text":"along those they will have places where"},{"startSec":436.96,"durationSec":4.4,"text":"they direct some of the beam"},{"startSec":438.96,"durationSec":3.519,"text":"so they get a super super super strong"},{"startSec":441.36,"durationSec":2.64,"text":"x-ray beam"},{"startSec":442.479,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"you shine it through the crystal and it"},{"startSec":444,"durationSec":2.96,"text":"basically makes a diffraction pattern of"},{"startSec":445.919,"durationSec":3.601,"text":"spots"},{"startSec":446.96,"durationSec":4.799,"text":"uh on

a"},{"startSec":481.919,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"it's an identity thing"},{"startSec":483.759,"durationSec":3.681,"text":"so walk me through it how did you come"},{"startSec":486,"durationSec":4.84,"text":"to be a bow tie person"},{"startSec":487.44,"durationSec":6.72,"text":"you totally are a person and like"},{"startSec":490.84,"durationSec":4.6,"text":"why uh"},{"startSec":494.16,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"people had been telling me that i was a"},{"startSec":495.44,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"bow

right"},{"startSec":499.599,"durationSec":4.72,"text":"uh i finally learned to tie one exactly"},{"startSec":502.639,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"halfway through my

it's"},{"startSec":865.76,"durationSec":2.879,"text":"like look"},{"startSec":866.72,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"we want them to be ready for next time"},{"startSec":868.639,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"we should want them to make a"},{"startSec":870,"durationSec":4,"text":"ton of money if this is a

like"},{"startSec":905.12,"durationSec":3.519,"text":"if it were the case so the basic"},{"startSec":906.72,"durationSec":4.72,"text":"proposal in this op-ed is hey"},{"startSec":908.639,"durationSec":4.721,"text":"we should basically ignore ip for a"},{"startSec":911.44,"durationSec":2.639,"text":"while or allow countries to do

hey"},{"startSec":940.079,"durationSec":5.361,"text":"you like whatever vaccine manufacturer"},{"startSec":943.839,"durationSec":3.841,"text":"elsewhere in the
