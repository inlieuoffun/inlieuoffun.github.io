right"},{"startSec":182.7,"durationSec":4.8,"text":"um yeah because testing has been a big"},{"startSec":184.379,"durationSec":4.621,"text":"issue um so yeah uh so definitely"},{"startSec":187.5,"durationSec":3.239,"text":"something that we know"},{"startSec":189,"durationSec":2.519,"text":"um and there's actually some really kind"},{"startSec":190.739,"durationSec":1.621,"text":"of"},{"startSec":191.519,"durationSec":2.94,"text":"um"},{"startSec":192.36,"durationSec":4.26,"text":"pluses to that and the biggest one

there's"},{"startSec":227.4,"durationSec":3.479,"text":"like yeah this does feel like something"},{"startSec":229.319,"durationSec":4.5,"text":"different too and it's been definitely"},{"startSec":230.879,"durationSec":5.341,"text":"even just like how the disease is acting"},{"startSec":233.819,"durationSec":3.541,"text":"um both transmission and how it presents"},{"startSec":236.22,"durationSec":3,"text":"um it feels like it's a little bit"},{"startSec":237.36,"durationSec":4.14,"text":"different"},{"startSec":239.22,"durationSec":4.799,"text":"so one of the things that Genevieve said"},{"startSec":241.5,"durationSec":4.379,"text":"really quickly was like oh this is so"},{"startSec":244.019,"durationSec":4.92,"text":"different like or like it's different"},{"startSec":245.879,"durationSec":6.241,"text":"kind of like covid but the interesting"},{"startSec":248.939,"durationSec":5.341,"text":"thing you did say was that monkey pox is"},{"startSec":252.12,"durationSec":4.519,"text":"a derivative of smallpox in the same way"},{"startSec":254.28,"durationSec":4.799,"text":"that covet is a derivative of

for"},{"startSec":261.18,"durationSec":5.82,"text":"it to like spread and the rapidity in"},{"startSec":263.94,"durationSec":4.14,"text":"which it's spreading is like new and"},{"startSec":267,"durationSec":4.62,"text":"like"},{"startSec":268.08,"durationSec":6,"text":"is new in in the round and like in terms"},{"startSec":271.62,"durationSec":5.04,"text":"of the the pandemic or endemic qualities"},{"startSec":274.08,"durationSec":4.38,"text":"that it possesses but like"},{"startSec":276.66,"durationSec":3.539,"text":"one of the things that you and I talked"},{"startSec":278.46,"durationSec":4.92,"text":"about a couple weeks ago that I think is"},{"startSec":280.199,"durationSec":4.801,"text":"super interesting was specifically the"},{"startSec":283.38,"durationSec":3.72,"text":"way in which it spread and whether it's"},{"startSec":285,"durationSec":5.78,"text":"labeled as a sexually transmitted"},{"startSec":287.1,"durationSec":5.819,"text":"disease versus uh other types of disease"},{"startSec":290.78,"durationSec":4.18,"text":"bloodborne or like I don't know the"},{"startSec":292.919,"durationSec":3.78,"text":"robot you are the doctor so I'm going to"},{"startSec":294.96,"durationSec":4.739,"text":"shut the [ __ ] up and like let

a"},{"startSec":302.699,"durationSec":4.381,"text":"sexually transmitted disease"},{"startSec":304.4,"durationSec":5.139,"text":"is a sexually transmitted disease when"},{"startSec":307.08,"durationSec":5.04,"text":"obviously herpes is actually not"},{"startSec":309.539,"durationSec":4.44,"text":"sexually transmitted technically like it"},{"startSec":312.12,"durationSec":3,"text":"doesn't have to be it can be bloodborne"},{"startSec":313.979,"durationSec":2.881,"text":"it can be like you can get it from"},{"startSec":315.12,"durationSec":2.579,"text":"kissing someone who has cold sores right"},{"startSec":316.86,"durationSec":3.54,"text":"like"},{"startSec":317.699,"durationSec":4.981,"text":"what are what is the terminology and"},{"startSec":320.4,"durationSec":3.9,"text":"labels what do they do like what is the"},{"startSec":322.68,"durationSec":4.859,"text":"purpose of that and can you just explain"},{"startSec":324.3,"durationSec":5.22,"text":"that really quickly yeah so I think that"},{"startSec":327.539,"durationSec":4.561,"text":"is kind of um"},{"startSec":329.52,"durationSec":4.739,"text":"a debate and a kind of a Hot Topic"},{"startSec":332.1,"durationSec":3.599,"text":"especially in social media"},{"startSec":334.259,"durationSec":4.141,"text":"um and like how people are talking about"},{"startSec":335.699,"durationSec":4.981,"text":"this and yeah so I can tell you like"},{"startSec":338.4,"durationSec":3.9,"text":"medically right like that"},{"startSec":340.68,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"um in some ways it feels like splitting"},{"startSec":342.3,"durationSec":4.619,"text":"hairs"},{"startSec":343.56,"durationSec":6.54,"text":"um in that I think it's important to"},{"startSec":346.919,"durationSec":5.28,"text":"note that it can be spread in other ways"},{"startSec":350.1,"durationSec":4.62,"text":"um but especially this outbreak"},{"startSec":352.199,"durationSec":3.78,"text":"it is like predominantly like there's"},{"startSec":354.72,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"the New England Journal of Medicine"},{"startSec":355.979,"durationSec":5.16,"text":"article that Associated so it was like I"},{"startSec":358.8,"durationSec":4.32,"text":"think 95 or 98 were associated

there's"},{"startSec":373.08,"durationSec":2.82,"text":"definitely exceptions and the exceptions"},{"startSec":374.4,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"prove the rule"},{"startSec":375.9,"durationSec":3.72,"text":"um like you know some like a handful of"},{"startSec":378,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"household contacts and we know that's"},{"startSec":379.62,"durationSec":3.18,"text":"possible"},{"startSec":381.36,"durationSec":2.82,"text":"um and especially with a kind of like"},{"startSec":382.8,"durationSec":4.739,"text":"you know if you live with someone with"},{"startSec":384.18,"durationSec":6.18,"text":"it there's like prolonged

hear if it can"},{"startSec":405.06,"durationSec":4.38,"text":"be transmitted directly through bodily"},{"startSec":407.1,"durationSec":4.439,"text":"fluid so especially semen and rectal and"},{"startSec":409.44,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"vaginal secretions"},{"startSec":411.539,"durationSec":4.38,"text":"um and also orally so"},{"startSec":413.52,"durationSec":4.679,"text":"um so far we do know that it does"},{"startSec":415.919,"durationSec":4.68,"text":"um it gets it's easier to be infected if"},{"startSec":418.199,"durationSec":4.921,"text":"you have broken skin or a mucosal"},{"startSec":420.599,"durationSec":3.841,"text":"surface right so it kind of makes sense"},{"startSec":423.12,"durationSec":2.76,"text":"um that's in like some of the guidelines"},{"startSec":424.44,"durationSec":3.96,"text":"too"},{"startSec":425.88,"durationSec":4.2,"text":"um so it does need like a route and sex"},{"startSec":428.4,"durationSec":3.18,"text":"just happens to be like a very efficient"},{"startSec":430.08,"durationSec":2.7,"text":"route to get in contact with some of"},{"startSec":431.58,"durationSec":4.019,"text":"those places"},{"startSec":432.78,"durationSec":5.639,"text":"not to be super weird but like when you"},{"startSec":435.599,"durationSec":5.04,"text":"have a lesion is that technically like a"},{"startSec":438.419,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"bloodborne like depend does it depend on"},{"startSec":440.639,"durationSec":3.661,"text":"the scale of the lesion or like what's"},{"startSec":442.5,"durationSec":3.419,"text":"going on is it bloodborne or is it"},{"startSec":444.3,"durationSec":3.839,"text":"possible as you said or is it like"},{"startSec":445.919,"durationSec":4.521,"text":"lymphatic like what is actually going on"},{"startSec":448.139,"durationSec":5.161,"text":"when you have a lesion like what is like"},{"startSec":450.44,"durationSec":3.94,"text":"the actual root of transmission so it"},{"startSec":453.3,"durationSec":2.76,"text":"probably is like a direct transmission"},{"startSec":454.38,"durationSec":4.14,"text":"like it is like kind of like syphilis"},{"startSec":456.06,"durationSec":4.079,"text":"like there is a a Shanker there's like a"},{"startSec":458.52,"durationSec":3.66,"text":"point of entry and that is like a direct"},{"startSec":460.139,"durationSec":3.241,"text":"infection in that spot"},{"startSec":462.18,"durationSec":3.06,"text":"um but then you're right then it kind of"},{"startSec":463.38,"durationSec":3.48,"text":"like gets it can get disseminated it's"},{"startSec":465.24,"durationSec":4.079,"text":"like it's like spread all over the

I"},{"startSec":825.48,"durationSec":3,"text":"think that's true in general too right"},{"startSec":827.279,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"like that's just one way that people"},{"startSec":828.48,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"could have a very mild disease course I"},{"startSec":830.639,"durationSec":3.481,"text":"think um just kind of like covid
