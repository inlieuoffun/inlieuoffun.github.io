think"},{"startSec":969.92,"durationSec":5.76,"text":"that like i think that kind of what"},{"startSec":971.68,"durationSec":4,"text":"you're saying is actually let's

no"},{"startSec":986.56,"durationSec":4.959,"text":"yes i mean broadbrush yes so i think"},{"startSec":989.519,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"this is one of those like things
