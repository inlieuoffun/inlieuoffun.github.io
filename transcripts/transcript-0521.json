most"},{"startSec":465.039,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"extreme version of the most extreme"},{"startSec":467.28,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"theory would be to say"},{"startSec":469.12,"durationSec":5.199,"text":"everything that the government does that"},{"startSec":471.36,"durationSec":4.32,"text":"isn't either

president"},{"startSec":485.68,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"so that would be the most extreme"},{"startSec":487.12,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"version of the unitary executive theory"},{"startSec":488.96,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"there's still a problem so it's kind of"},{"startSec":490.4,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"the idea so this is the idea that like"},{"startSec":493.12,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"like the administrative like the fourth"},{"startSec":494.96,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"like the fourth"},{"startSec":496.56,"durationSec":3.759,"text":"like the fourth branch of government"},{"startSec":497.84,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"branch right is really just should be"},{"startSec":500.319,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"just controlled by the president so if"},{"startSec":502.08,"durationSec":3.519,"text":"if you if you hold to that theory right"},{"startSec":503.919,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"the idea would be something like"},{"startSec":505.599,"durationSec":3.841,"text":"you know if if the

like"},{"startSec":521.76,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"if facebook is down because there was"},{"startSec":523.2,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"some administrator who somewhere decided"},{"startSec":525.04,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"that they were going to pull the plug if"},{"startSec":526.8,"durationSec":3.52,"text":"if joe biden got on the phone and said
