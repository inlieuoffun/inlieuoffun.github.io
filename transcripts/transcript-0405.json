that's all that's awfully specific"},{"startSec":300.24,"durationSec":5.04,"text":"and the implication of that"},{"startSec":301.759,"durationSec":6.801,"text":"is that you confidently handle woodwinds"},{"startSec":305.28,"durationSec":5.28,"text":"and uh i know you play stringed"},{"startSec":308.56,"durationSec":5.199,"text":"instruments because you're a harpist"},{"startSec":310.56,"durationSec":6.56,"text":"but what are your woodwinds um"},{"startSec":313.759,"durationSec":5.521,"text":"so when i was a kid i essentially"},{"startSec":317.12,"durationSec":3.359,"text":"took up every instrument i could because"},{"startSec":319.28,"durationSec":3.759,"text":"i loved"},{"startSec":320.479,"durationSec":4.321,"text":"sort of applying principles from one"},{"startSec":323.039,"durationSec":4.321,"text":"instrument to another"},{"startSec":324.8,"durationSec":3.839,"text":"and sort of seeing how once you'd"},{"startSec":327.36,"durationSec":1.839,"text":"learned how it worked on the

but"},{"startSec":332.8,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"this came kind of i felt very sorry for"},{"startSec":335.6,"durationSec":4.64,"text":"my brother because he's older than me"},{"startSec":337.68,"durationSec":3.359,"text":"and i look up to him and he would take"},{"startSec":340.24,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"up an instrument"},{"startSec":341.039,"durationSec":3.921,"text":"and i would go oh that's quite nice and"},{"startSec":343.28,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"take it off a year later but"},{"startSec":344.96,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"he wouldn't really practice and i would"},{"startSec":347.52,"durationSec":2.48,"text":"and so i"},{"startSec":348.16,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"overtook him on a whole load of"},{"startSec":350,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"instruments and he gave them up so"},{"startSec":352,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"eventually my parents turned round off"},{"startSec":353.68,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"this happened about seven times"},{"startSec":355.36,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"they said right he's doing brass you're"},{"startSec":357.84,"durationSec":4.72,"text":"not allowed to touch"},{"startSec":359.12,"durationSec":8.72,"text":"brass and so there we go so what is what"},{"startSec":362.56,"durationSec":5.28,"text":"does he play"},{"startSec":371.56,"durationSec":5.639,"text":"[Laughter]"},{"startSec":375.44,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"but i was actually really surprised that"},{"startSec":377.199,"durationSec":2.801,"text":"you didn't say the wind instrument that"},{"startSec":379.68,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"you"},{"startSec":380,"durationSec":7.12,"text":"play is the organ because"},{"startSec":383.12,"durationSec":7.04,"text":"the first fun fact about"},{"startSec":387.12,"durationSec":3.359,"text":"organs is that they are wind instruments"},{"startSec":390.16,"durationSec":2.72,"text":"not"},{"startSec":390.479,"durationSec":4.241,"text":"keyboards but they're not

woodwind"},{"startSec":398.96,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"because there's a there there is a"},{"startSec":401.039,"durationSec":4,"text":"woodwind section"},{"startSec":402.24,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"according to this video that i watched"},{"startSec":405.039,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"right"},{"startSec":405.52,"durationSec":3.519,"text":"so there you can actually simulate flute"},{"startSec":407.919,"durationSec":3.601,"text":"because they have they have"},{"startSec":409.039,"durationSec":3.761,"text":"wood pipes and stuff like that right"},{"startSec":411.52,"durationSec":2.32,"text":"well i mean this is kind of the thing"},{"startSec":412.8,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"about the
