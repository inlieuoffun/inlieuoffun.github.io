how"},{"startSec":3128.88,"durationSec":4.64,"text":"the game works"},{"startSec":3129.92,"durationSec":4.399,"text":"um so there were eight players

they"},{"startSec":3193.68,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"expected the roma to free ride"},{"startSec":3196.24,"durationSec":4.8,"text":"right so this is how i

then"},{"startSec":3264.079,"durationSec":3.601,"text":"regressions"},{"startSec":3265.2,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"and then they look that up to

to"},{"startSec":3358.4,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"include them in the study so the game"},{"startSec":3359.92,"durationSec":2.48,"text":"also has an audio component so it
