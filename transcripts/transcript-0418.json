is"},{"startSec":244.239,"durationSec":3.761,"text":"such that everybody has a different"},{"startSec":246.48,"durationSec":2.08,"text":"response to it so i probably talked to"},{"startSec":248,"durationSec":2.239,"text":"like"},{"startSec":248.56,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"i don't know like five or six or eight"},{"startSec":250.239,"durationSec":2.881,"text":"different

it"},{"startSec":283.68,"durationSec":2.48,"text":"already"},{"startSec":284.32,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"um but who i want to know about is the"},{"startSec":286.16,"durationSec":3.039,"text":"is the people who"},{"startSec":287.6,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"really don't think that's something who"},{"startSec":289.199,"durationSec":3.841,"text":"could that could

angles"},{"startSec":358.4,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"right and i'm i i'm not gonna say that"},{"startSec":360.72,"durationSec":2.64,"text":"no angles were bisected in the"},{"startSec":362.16,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"production of this"},{"startSec":363.36,"durationSec":5.6,"text":"book i can think of at least one"},{"startSec":366.4,"durationSec":4.4,"text":"um and that is like that's sort of where"},{"startSec":368.96,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"it all starts so in some sense that's"},{"startSec":370.8,"durationSec":3.839,"text":"the beginning right euclid is like where"},{"startSec":372.56,"durationSec":3.52,"text":"we first think of geometry as a really"},{"startSec":374.639,"durationSec":4.481,"text":"formal subject but"},{"startSec":376.08,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"you know that term nowadays is used much"},{"startSec":379.12,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"more broadly than"},{"startSec":380,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"that and you know what i'd say as a"},{"startSec":382.4,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"first a"},{"startSec":383.44,"durationSec":4.319,"text":"sentence

things"},{"startSec":397.6,"durationSec":1.68,"text":"the same or are they different and say"},{"startSec":398.96,"durationSec":1.84,"text":"like"},{"startSec":399.28,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"well wait there's degrees things could"},{"startSec":400.8,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"be very similar close together or people"},{"startSec":402.72,"durationSec":3.199,"text":"or things could be far apart

about"},{"startSec":413.919,"durationSec":5.521,"text":"in the book um and so that idea"},{"startSec":417.68,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"is incredibly powerful the idea of

away"},{"startSec":422.88,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"um that leads you to what do you mean by"},{"startSec":425.039,"durationSec":2.961,"text":"sort of

the"},{"startSec":463.199,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"circumference right"},{"startSec":465.52,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"well let me say what is important and"},{"startSec":466.879,"durationSec":3.121,"text":"then you'll see if you disagree"},{"startSec":468.56,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"what's important is that there's such

i"},{"startSec":781.44,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"hit reply and then google writes yeah"},{"startSec":783.6,"durationSec":4.799,"text":"sure and i'm like"},{"startSec":785.04,"durationSec":4.96,"text":"that would be great but did you actually"},{"startSec":788.399,"durationSec":3.281,"text":"change your answer or just the way
