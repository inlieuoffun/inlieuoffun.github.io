up"},{"startSec":1347,"durationSec":7.59,"text":"between 150 and 200 masks a day that you"},{"startSec":1351.89,"durationSec":7.38,"text":"could realistically wait yeah if you if"},{"startSec":1354.59,"durationSec":7.89,"text":"you had a partner and you were both like"},{"startSec":1359.27,"durationSec":6.03,"text":"and you treat it off so that there
