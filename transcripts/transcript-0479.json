the"},{"startSec":171.84,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"you know the the pandemic is over"},{"startSec":174.16,"durationSec":2.48,"text":"there's there was a phase you know

how"},{"startSec":314.72,"durationSec":7.12,"text":"exponentially that just explodes right"},{"startSec":317.44,"durationSec":6.64,"text":"um and so three and a half to four

oh"},{"startSec":407.68,"durationSec":6.639,"text":"england found 88 against symptomatic 79"},{"startSec":411.759,"durationSec":3.761,"text":"but then israel said suddenly it
