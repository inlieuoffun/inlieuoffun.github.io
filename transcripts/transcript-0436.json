do"},{"startSec":307.52,"durationSec":3.679,"text":"security or cryptography so i was just"},{"startSec":309.52,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"sort of like if i just show up at this"},{"startSec":311.199,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"academic conference about cryptography"},{"startSec":312.96,"durationSec":2.56,"text":"is anyone gonna like look at me where"},{"startSec":314.639,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"he's like no just"},{"startSec":315.52,"durationSec":3.519,"text":"just go if you want you know and have"},{"startSec":317.919,"durationSec":3.041,"text":"you know have fun"},{"startSec":319.039,"durationSec":4.641,"text":"they'll just make jokes about dongles in"},{"startSec":320.96,"durationSec":2.72,"text":"front of you sorry"},{"startSec":331.919,"durationSec":3.521,"text":"so long story short i i was doing it on"},{"startSec":333.84,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"my own and teaching myself and then i"},{"startSec":335.44,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"especially got

elliptic"},{"startSec":358.08,"durationSec":2.8,"text":"curves and i thought they were really"},{"startSec":359.28,"durationSec":2.56,"text":"cool and then someone said oh they'll be"},{"startSec":360.88,"durationSec":2.56,"text":"broken"},{"startSec":361.84,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"if the quantum computers come i was like"},{"startSec":363.44,"durationSec":5.199,"text":"i'm so sad that's my favorite thing"},{"startSec":365.28,"durationSec":5.52,"text":"like well there is a very niche"},{"startSec":368.639,"durationSec":4,"text":"new area of quantum cryptography post"},{"startSec":370.8,"durationSec":3.839,"text":"quantum cryptography that does use"},{"startSec":372.639,"durationSec":3.041,"text":"elliptic curves it's called

i"},{"startSec":377.84,"durationSec":4.479,"text":"started getting really deep"},{"startSec":379.28,"durationSec":5.759,"text":"into that and only about"},{"startSec":382.319,"durationSec":4.641,"text":"10 to 20 people in the world at the time"},{"startSec":385.039,"durationSec":2.321,"text":"were actually doing research on it was a"},{"startSec":386.96,"durationSec":2.079,"text":"very"},{"startSec":387.36,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"niche new new field and i was like i"},{"startSec":389.039,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"read all the

have"},{"startSec":394.56,"durationSec":3.359,"text":"it right here like because there are"},{"startSec":396.16,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"only about"},{"startSec":397.919,"durationSec":3.921,"text":"there were like two dozen papers at all"},{"startSec":400,"durationSec":2.72,"text":"in the entire area at the time which was"},{"startSec":401.84,"durationSec":2.96,"text":"about"},{"startSec":402.72,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"2015 2016 and i started to give talks"},{"startSec":404.8,"durationSec":2.32,"text":"about it because i was like this is"},{"startSec":406.4,"durationSec":2.96,"text":"really cool"},{"startSec":407.12,"durationSec":3.919,"text":"i want to talk about it it forces you

at some point a person was like"},{"startSec":414.4,"durationSec":2.639,"text":"oh"},{"startSec":415.36,"durationSec":3.279,"text":"you write this programming language and"},{"startSec":417.039,"durationSec":3.361,"text":"you're really into cryptography"},{"startSec":418.639,"durationSec":4,"text":"but you don't do it for your day job do"},{"startSec":420.4,"durationSec":5.199,"text":"you want to write cryptography"},{"startSec":422.639,"durationSec":4.161,"text":"and other stuff for a team of like

that"},{"startSec":454.88,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"but you want to deploy the boring stuff"},{"startSec":457.039,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"for real people"},{"startSec":458.56,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"for like millions and billions of people"},{"startSec":461.199,"durationSec":4.161,"text":"but it's
