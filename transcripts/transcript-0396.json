they"},{"startSec":1414.799,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"get to 17 or 13 like that we don't know"},{"startSec":1416.72,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"but we know"},{"startSec":1418.159,"durationSec":4.64,"text":"like how they're figuring out it's a"},{"startSec":1420.96,"durationSec":6.319,"text":"different year"},{"startSec":1422.799,"durationSec":6.641,"text":"cool i i i extended the invitation"},{"startSec":1427.279,"durationSec":3.121,"text":"on the assumption that you knew

that's okay yeah i know"},{"startSec":1435.919,"durationSec":3.281,"text":"part of the answer"},{"startSec":1437.279,"durationSec":3.041,"text":"yeah by the way that was an excellent"},{"startSec":1439.2,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"answer and i love"},{"startSec":1440.32,"durationSec":4.959,"text":"when people say i don't know um because"},{"startSec":1442.88,"durationSec":5.84,"text":"like i would so much rather you tell me"},{"startSec":1445.279,"durationSec":6.64,"text":"but like yeah wow"},{"startSec":1448.72,"durationSec":7.12,"text":"yeah they try so they track sap flow and"},{"startSec":1451.919,"durationSec":6,"text":"so somehow that increases their counter"},{"startSec":1455.84,"durationSec":4.319,"text":"so there's a lot this is getting beyond"},{"startSec":1457.919,"durationSec":6,"text":"cicadas but there is work on how"},{"startSec":1460.159,"durationSec":5.281,"text":"insects count um that i'm not super"},{"startSec":1463.919,"durationSec":4,"text":"familiar with but there was an"},{"startSec":1465.44,"durationSec":4.64,"text":"experiment where they took some ants in"},{"startSec":1467.919,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"the desert i think in

out"},{"startSec":1473.919,"durationSec":4.401,"text":"like how they found the nest"},{"startSec":1475.84,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"uh until they glued little stilts to"},{"startSec":1478.32,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"their legs"},{"startSec":1479.6,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"and when they would run back to the

they"},{"startSec":1492.24,"durationSec":4.559,"text":"overshoot the nest because they think"},{"startSec":1494,"durationSec":4.64,"text":"they're not where they think they are"},{"startSec":1496.799,"durationSec":4.321,"text":"that is the best thing i have"},{"startSec":1498.64,"durationSec":2.48,"text":"ever heard"},{"startSec":1506.4,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"it is a

are"},{"startSec":1524.24,"durationSec":5.52,"text":"so like insects count somehow"},{"startSec":1527.36,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"different insects count uh but like how"},{"startSec":1529.76,"durationSec":4.32,"text":"they do that in their little tiny brains"},{"startSec":1532.24,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"i don't think we know at least i don't"},{"startSec":1534.08,"durationSec":4.959,"text":"know i thought it was pheromone trails"},{"startSec":1536.4,"durationSec":4.639,"text":"that like ants put down or something"},{"startSec":1539.039,"durationSec":3.361,"text":"so that's like not it but not for long"},{"startSec":1541.039,"durationSec":2.721,"text":"things like that where there's blowing"},{"startSec":1542.4,"durationSec":2.56,"text":"sand and the pheromone trail is not"},{"startSec":1543.76,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"going to like hang

and"},{"startSec":1548.559,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"then you lose the pheromone trail so you"},{"startSec":1550,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"got to come up with something different"},{"startSec":1552.159,"durationSec":3.201,"text":"which is why they use that species"},{"startSec":1553.6,"durationSec":5.6,"text":"because they don't use pheromones"},{"startSec":1555.36,"durationSec":5.679,"text":"yeah that's kind of amazing um"},{"startSec":1559.2,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"yeah this is like an incredible like i"},{"startSec":1561.039,"durationSec":5.601,"text":"feel like dorky"},{"startSec":1562.32,"durationSec":8.959,"text":"like dorky me is like um"},{"startSec":1566.64,"durationSec":6.56,"text":"so uh"},{"startSec":1571.279,"durationSec":4.481,"text":"wouldn't a really easy way to test your"},{"startSec":1573.2,"durationSec":5.2,"text":"experiment be to like"},{"startSec":1575.76,"durationSec":4,"text":"put a bunch of the nymphs on some some"},{"startSec":1578.4,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"buried"},{"startSec":1579.76,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"like
