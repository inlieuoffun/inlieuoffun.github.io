a"},{"startSec":770.079,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"diverse field and"},{"startSec":771.76,"durationSec":5.6,"text":"we want people to be as intrigued

on"},{"startSec":780.079,"durationSec":4,"text":"your podcast that there's more than"},{"startSec":781.519,"durationSec":4.481,"text":"500 species of sharks does that include"},{"startSec":784.079,"durationSec":5.44,"text":"rays or is that just sharks"},{"startSec":786,"durationSec":5.2,"text":"alone that is just sharks okay so that"},{"startSec":789.519,"durationSec":3.841,"text":"is not including rays"},{"startSec":791.2,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"um and i also want to say that roughly"},{"startSec":793.36,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"75 to 80"},{"startSec":794.88,"durationSec":4.32,"text":"of those 500 sharks at their max

great"},{"startSec":801.92,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"hammerheads that you see all the time"},{"startSec":803.519,"durationSec":2.801,"text":"and great white they're all shorter than"},{"startSec":805.36,"durationSec":3.279,"text":"me"},{"startSec":806.32,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"and what is the difference between a"},{"startSec":808.639,"durationSec":4.801,"text":"shark and a ray because i think most"},{"startSec":810.56,"durationSec":5.68,"text":"people look at a ray and say that's cute"},{"startSec":813.44,"durationSec":4.079,"text":"and look at a shark and say that's scary"},{"startSec":816.24,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"and look at a small"},{"startSec":817.519,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"shark which as you point out are the"},{"startSec":820.48,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"vast majority"},{"startSec":821.6,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"and say that's not quite really a shark"},{"startSec":824.32,"durationSec":5.04,"text":"that's a dogfish"},{"startSec":826.16,"durationSec":6.56,"text":"um and so"},{"startSec":829.36,"durationSec":6.479,"text":"what are the basic subdivisions here"},{"startSec":832.72,"durationSec":5.6,"text":"and to what extent are rays and sharks"},{"startSec":835.839,"durationSec":6.161,"text":"really the same family and to what"},{"startSec":838.32,"durationSec":5.92,"text":"extent are they not"},{"startSec":842,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"want to take this one amani sure i can"},{"startSec":844.24,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"start and then you can just like cover"},{"startSec":845.76,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"in where i miss things"},{"startSec":847.12,"durationSec":4,"text":"um so the easiest distinction between a"},{"startSec":850,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"shark and a ray"},{"startSec":851.12,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"is that the gills on a ray are on the"},{"startSec":853.36,"durationSec":3.279,"text":"bottom"},{"startSec":854.24,"durationSec":4.8,"text":"right so sharks all sharks have their"},{"startSec":856.639,"durationSec":5.76,"text":"rays on the sides of their body"},{"startSec":859.04,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"um and rays it's on the bottom so"},{"startSec":862.399,"durationSec":3.921,"text":"for example if you guys know what a"},{"startSec":863.92,"durationSec":3.919,"text":"sawfish is that's a huge ray they get"},{"startSec":866.32,"durationSec":2.24,"text":"really big but they're not a shark"},{"startSec":867.839,"durationSec":2.24,"text":"they're a ray"},{"startSec":868.56,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"because their gills are on the bottom of"},{"startSec":870.079,"durationSec":3.681,"text":"their body um"},{"startSec":871.76,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"rays are also generally flattened in the"},{"startSec":873.76,"durationSec":3.439,"text":"way that sharks are not sharks have that"},{"startSec":875.36,"durationSec":5.36,"text":"kind of like torpedo body"},{"startSec":877.199,"durationSec":5.041,"text":"um and rays are all flatter um"},{"startSec":880.72,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"they all have those like wings on the"},{"startSec":882.24,"durationSec":2.719,"text":"side that's how they move around whereas"},{"startSec":883.76,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"sharks have like distinct"},{"startSec":884.959,"durationSec":6.961,"text":"fins all over um"},{"startSec":888.32,"durationSec":5.84,"text":"megan yeah and"},{"startSec":891.92,"durationSec":3.919,"text":"sharks and reyes are part of a group"},{"startSec":894.16,"durationSec":4.64,"text":"called elasmobrinks"},{"startSec":895.839,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"elasmobrings is the family that they all"},{"startSec":898.8,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"belong to and they're"},{"startSec":900.079,"durationSec":5.2,"text":"fish so rays and sharks they're all fish"},{"startSec":903.36,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"other animals that are included in"},{"startSec":905.279,"durationSec":4.481,"text":"elasmobranks"},{"startSec":906.48,"durationSec":5.599,"text":"are also skates and chimeras so"},{"startSec":909.76,"durationSec":4.639,"text":"it's a really diverse group of animals"},{"startSec":912.079,"durationSec":4.161,"text":"and there are some distinct differences"},{"startSec":914.399,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"like amani was saying with the gills is"},{"startSec":916.24,"durationSec":3.599,"text":"a really good giveaway"},{"startSec":917.839,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"between a shark and a ray even if it's"},{"startSec":919.839,"durationSec":3.761,"text":"kind of difficult to see"},{"startSec":921.279,"durationSec":4.161,"text":"a skate is also different than a ray and"},{"startSec":923.6,"durationSec":3.599,"text":"one of the easiest ways to tell that"},{"startSec":925.44,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"the difference between a skate and a ray"},{"startSec":927.199,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"is if they have dorsal fins"},{"startSec":929.04,"durationSec":3.52,"text":"um the skates will have these big dorsal"},{"startSec":931.279,"durationSec":2.48,"text":"fins whereas"},{"startSec":932.56,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"oh wait actually i think i might be"},{"startSec":933.759,"durationSec":3.921,"text":"wrong about that imani what"},{"startSec":935.6,"durationSec":3.599,"text":"can you help me out with that is that i"},{"startSec":937.68,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"don't know you tell the difference"},{"startSec":939.199,"durationSec":3.121,"text":"see even weakness you're quite honest"},{"startSec":940.88,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"i've like never had to tell the"},{"startSec":942.32,"durationSec":3.439,"text":"difference between a skate and a ray and"},{"startSec":943.92,"durationSec":5.359,"text":"i don't want to say the wrong thing"},{"startSec":945.759,"durationSec":7.041,"text":"i know i think of rays as like curvy"},{"startSec":949.279,"durationSec":4.081,"text":"and skates as pointy i mean yeah they do"},{"startSec":952.8,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"have like"},{"startSec":953.36,"durationSec":5.12,"text":"more pointy noses for sure"},{"startSec":956.48,"durationSec":3.359,"text":"um when you look at all the varying"},{"startSec":958.48,"durationSec":2.08,"text":"types of skates and rays and then the"},{"startSec":959.839,"durationSec":3.841,"text":"last group"},{"startSec":960.56,"durationSec":6.24,"text":"in that elasma breaks is chimeras which"},{"startSec":963.68,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"are very ancient um and"},{"startSec":966.8,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"super weird and live in the deep sea and"},{"startSec":968.56,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"like look really odd"},{"startSec":970.24,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"i've never heard of them what are they"},{"startSec":972.8,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"oh"},{"startSec":973.36,"durationSec":5.52,"text":"you need to look them up so their common"},{"startSec":977.04,"durationSec":4.799,"text":"name is like a rat fish they look"},{"startSec":978.88,"durationSec":3.759,"text":"like these deep sea rats but they're so"},{"startSec":981.839,"durationSec":2.961,"text":"cool"},{"startSec":982.639,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"like i i don't know they're really cool"},{"startSec":984.8,"durationSec":3.279,"text":"i i don't want to"},{"startSec":985.759,"durationSec":3.841,"text":"do any disgrace to how cool chimeras are"},{"startSec":988.079,"durationSec":5.361,"text":"so you should definitely look them"},{"startSec":989.6,"durationSec":7.12,"text":"up it starts with ch not a k chimera"},{"startSec":993.44,"durationSec":5.12,"text":"yeah it sounds like a mythical beast"},{"startSec":996.72,"durationSec":4.32,"text":"it does well so there it is a mythical"},{"startSec":998.56,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"beast um but there is also"},{"startSec":1001.04,"durationSec":3.2,"text":"chimeras which have been around for a"},{"startSec":1002.72,"durationSec":3.039,"text":"very long time and"},{"startSec":1004.24,"durationSec":3.039,"text":"from my knowledge the easiest way to"},{"startSec":1005.759,"durationSec":2.801,"text":"tell them apart is they have a

deep"},{"startSec":1025.199,"durationSec":3.921,"text":"sea i don't know if there are any"},{"startSec":1027.12,"durationSec":4.88,"text":"chimeras that

did the sharks survive"},{"startSec":1314.48,"durationSec":6.48,"text":"so um i i will start by saying"},{"startSec":1318.72,"durationSec":3.199,"text":"that if you ever encounter a shark in"},{"startSec":1320.96,"durationSec":3.199,"text":"the wild"},{"startSec":1321.919,"durationSec":4.161,"text":"and they get hooked and swallow the

was"},{"startSec":1403.28,"durationSec":2.96,"text":"convinced would kill them"},{"startSec":1404.64,"durationSec":3.279,"text":"like if another shark bit them

the"},{"startSec":1413.84,"durationSec":5.12,"text":"only way for them to get leverage"},{"startSec":1415.52,"durationSec":4.399,"text":"and you can see some really nasty

is"},{"startSec":1434.96,"durationSec":5.28,"text":"possible the shark survived"},{"startSec":1437.6,"durationSec":5.36,"text":"but probably my grandfather

the"},{"startSec":1480.4,"durationSec":4.399,"text":"line out and it swam off"},{"startSec":1481.919,"durationSec":4.481,"text":"um they are super resilient we

punch"},{"startSec":1494.799,"durationSec":2.24,"text":"basically"},{"startSec":1495.679,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"um and then we'll put them back in

tell"},{"startSec":1500.799,"durationSec":3.601,"text":"that we took muscle from there it's like"},{"startSec":1503.039,"durationSec":4.321,"text":"completely healed up"},{"startSec":1504.4,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"um so they are super resilient but then"},{"startSec":1507.36,"durationSec":1.52,"text":"again"},{"startSec":1507.76,"durationSec":3.039,"text":"especially with like

just have some really"},{"startSec":1610.72,"durationSec":5.839,"text":"incredible adaptations"},{"startSec":1612.96,"durationSec":7.04,"text":"yeah so tell us about the

completely"},{"startSec":1623.52,"durationSec":5.12,"text":"addicted to this podcast"},{"startSec":1625.44,"durationSec":5.28,"text":"and uh but for those members of

what"},{"startSec":1639.76,"durationSec":5.2,"text":"are you doing with it"},{"startSec":1641.679,"durationSec":6.081,"text":"yeah so megan came to me with this idea"},{"startSec":1644.96,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"um which i thought was a brilliant idea"},{"startSec":1647.76,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"because"},{"startSec":1648.32,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"as i said earlier scientific papers are"},{"startSec":1650.64,"durationSec":5.44,"text":"really hard to read"},{"startSec":1652.48,"durationSec":5.04,"text":"um and even even as a scientist i

know"},{"startSec":1662.72,"durationSec":4.24,"text":"um so she was basically like what if we"},{"startSec":1665.279,"durationSec":3.681,"text":"have a podcast where we"},{"startSec":1666.96,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"read these scientific papers beforehand"},{"startSec":1668.96,"durationSec":4.079,"text":"we have the first author come
