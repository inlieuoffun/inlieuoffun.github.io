you're"},{"startSec":224.64,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"on you were talking about kind of pleo"},{"startSec":226.239,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"and a lot of the ethics around

correctly"},{"startSec":240,"durationSec":4.959,"text":"so this book came from me just loving"},{"startSec":243.439,"durationSec":2.8,"text":"robots and talking to everyone

we"},{"startSec":253.599,"durationSec":2.88,"text":"tend to"},{"startSec":254.48,"durationSec":3.599,"text":"subconsciously compare them to humans"},{"startSec":256.479,"durationSec":3.361,"text":"and compare artificial intelligence to"},{"startSec":258.079,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"human intelligence so whether that's"},{"startSec":259.84,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"in our stock photo imagery whether"},{"startSec":261.359,"durationSec":2.321,"text":"that's in our conversations about robots"},{"startSec":262.88,"durationSec":3.12,"text":"and jobs"},{"startSec":263.68,"durationSec":3.92,"text":"whether that's talking about my children"},{"startSec":266,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"like people are always like okay you"},{"startSec":267.6,"durationSec":3.039,"text":"must find it so interesting to watch"},{"startSec":269.04,"durationSec":2.8,"text":"your children's intelligence develop and"},{"startSec":270.639,"durationSec":3.921,"text":"compare it to robots"},{"startSec":271.84,"durationSec":4.639,"text":"and uh at some point i was just like"},{"startSec":274.56,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"this is the wrong analogy"},{"startSec":276.479,"durationSec":3.681,"text":"it's just it doesn't make sense because"},{"startSec":278.32,"durationSec":4.8,"text":"artificial intelligence is not like"},{"startSec":280.16,"durationSec":4.4,"text":"human intelligence and why are we trying"},{"startSec":283.12,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"to recreate something we already have"},{"startSec":284.56,"durationSec":3.6,"text":"when we can create something different"},{"startSec":286.16,"durationSec":4.8,"text":"that's supplemental and so"},{"startSec":288.16,"durationSec":4.08,"text":"i feel like animals are a much better"},{"startSec":290.96,"durationSec":2.959,"text":"analogy for"},{"startSec":292.24,"durationSec":3.84,"text":"thinking about these technologies and"},{"startSec":293.919,"durationSec":3.441,"text":"and and they that analogy changes the"},{"startSec":296.08,"durationSec":2.48,"text":"conversation in a lot of really"},{"startSec":297.36,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"significant ways"},{"startSec":298.56,"durationSec":4.4,"text":"um and it makes so much sense like we"},{"startSec":301.12,"durationSec":2.639,"text":"have these things that can sense and"},{"startSec":302.96,"durationSec":3.36,"text":"think and"},{"startSec":303.759,"durationSec":4,"text":"make autonomous decisions and learn and"},{"startSec":306.32,"durationSec":2.879,"text":"uh it's not the first time that we've"},{"startSec":307.759,"durationSec":2.72,"text":"dealt with something like that"},{"startSec":309.199,"durationSec":3.201,"text":"and we've partnered with animals"},{"startSec":310.479,"durationSec":3.28,"text":"throughout history not because they have"},{"startSec":312.4,"durationSec":3.44,"text":"our skill sets"},{"startSec":313.759,"durationSec":3.921,"text":"but because they do things that we can't"},{"startSec":315.84,"durationSec":5.76,"text":"do and that's useful so"},{"startSec":317.68,"durationSec":5.44,"text":"um i thought that thinking about"},{"startSec":321.6,"durationSec":2.879,"text":"robots and artificial intelligence as"},{"startSec":323.12,"durationSec":1.919,"text":"partners and what we're trying to"},{"startSec":324.479,"durationSec":1.921,"text":"achieve"},{"startSec":325.039,"durationSec":2.72,"text":"kind of like we've done with animals"},{"startSec":326.4,"durationSec":2.16,"text":"that was kind of the starting point for"},{"startSec":327.759,"durationSec":2.241,"text":"the book"},{"startSec":328.56,"durationSec":3.04,"text":"and it goes through how we've used"},{"startSec":330,"durationSec":2.72,"text":"animals for work for weaponry for"},{"startSec":331.6,"durationSec":3.68,"text":"companionship"},{"startSec":332.72,"durationSec":4.4,"text":"it even

into"},{"startSec":339.039,"durationSec":3.121,"text":"the future so"},{"startSec":340.24,"durationSec":3.76,"text":"yeah that's that's the concept of the"},{"startSec":342.16,"durationSec":2.64,"text":"book and i'm pretty happy with how it"},{"startSec":344,"durationSec":4.8,"text":"turned out"},{"startSec":344.8,"durationSec":6,"text":"so i have an initial threshold question"},{"startSec":348.8,"durationSec":5.28,"text":"about the analogy"},{"startSec":350.8,"durationSec":7.2,"text":"which is it seems to me that one"},{"startSec":354.08,"durationSec":7.44,"text":"we the analogy clearly works along"},{"startSec":358,"durationSec":6.4,"text":"one axis which is the axis"},{"startSec":361.52,"durationSec":5.119,"text":"that you just described but there's"},{"startSec":364.4,"durationSec":4.56,"text":"another

excited"},{"startSec":383.84,"durationSec":4.16,"text":"right now"},{"startSec":384.88,"durationSec":6.879,"text":"and uh robots"},{"startSec":388,"durationSec":7.36,"text":"don't get excited um uh"},{"startSec":391.759,"durationSec":7.201,"text":"or you know uh janine"},{"startSec":395.36,"durationSec":4.48,"text":"who's a maybe watching sent me a
