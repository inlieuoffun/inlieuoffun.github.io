think"},{"startSec":353.26,"durationSec":6.96,"text":"the bottom line is that there was going"},{"startSec":356.44,"durationSec":6,"text":"to be a pickup and hiring at some

and"},{"startSec":435.61,"durationSec":4.559,"text":"maybe people think that there was still"},{"startSec":437.139,"durationSec":5.421,"text":"a lot of layoffs happening may just be"},{"startSec":440.169,"durationSec":5.31,"text":"because states were clearing the backlog"},{"startSec":442.56,"durationSec":5.44,"text":"but I mean I think the bottom line for"},{"startSec":445.479,"durationSec":4.831,"text":"the jobs report is that yes it showed"},{"startSec":448,"durationSec":4.8,"text":"that we turned a corner a little bit"},{"startSec":450.31,"durationSec":5.579,"text":"sooner than expected which is good but"},{"startSec":452.8,"durationSec":5.04,"text":"if you look at how deeply we are in
